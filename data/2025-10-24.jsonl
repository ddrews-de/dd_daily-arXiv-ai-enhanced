Based on a\nsample of 186 undergraduate students from Engineering, Geology, and Interactive\nDesign programs, the study combines exam performance data with self-perceived\npreparedness surveys to develop unit-specific logistic regression models. The\nfindings reveal consistent structural disadvantages for students from\nnon-engineering programs, especially in concept-heavy units such as Inference\nand Regression. Academic stage and perception of competence also emerged as\nimportant predictors, though their effects varied across units. The results\nalign with prior research on statistical thinking and self-efficacy, and\nsupport the need for targeted pedagogical interventions and curricular\nalignment. This disaggregated approach offers a more nuanced understanding of\nacademic vulnerability in statistics education and contributes to the design of\nevidence-based, context-sensitive strategies to reduce failure and improve\nlearning outcomes."}

To address this\nconcern, we propose \"MCC: Model Context Contracts\" a novel framework that\nenables LLMs to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts through\nMCP-like protocol. This integration allows AI agents to invoke blockchain smart\ncontracts, facilitating more dynamic and context-aware interactions between\nusers and blockchain networks. Essentially, it empowers users to interact with\nblockchain systems and perform transactions using queries in natural language.\nWithin this proposed architecture, blockchain smart contracts can function as\nintelligent agents capable of recognizing user input in natural language and\nexecuting the corresponding transactions. To ensure that the LLM accurately\ninterprets natural language inputs and maps them to the appropriate MCP\nfunctions, the LLM was fine-tuned using a custom dataset comprising user inputs\npaired with their corresponding MCP server functions. This fine-tuning process\nsignificantly improved the platform's performance and accuracy. To validate the\neffectiveness of MCC, we have developed an end-to-end prototype implemented on\nthe Rahasak blockchain with the fine-tuned Llama-4 LLM. To the best of our\nknowledge, this research represents the first approach to using the concept of\nModel Context Protocol to integrate LLMs with blockchain."}

Prior approaches often induce\nan out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by\nintroducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect\nrealistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate\nthat our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found\nin human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our\nbugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,\noutperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k\nbugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug\ndatasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench\nVerified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on\nSWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over\nthree seeds."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a\npromising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to\nchallenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management.

This study introduces an\nenhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two\nexisting benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling\nscenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control\nstrategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic\nagent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action\nmasking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to\nlearn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When\naction masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the\nperformance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role\nof action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization\ndiminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides\na valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions\nin industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on\ncentralization versus specialization."}

Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting\na wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different\n$\\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the\nclassifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds\nthrough tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework\nequipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally\nfine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,\nallowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in\npractice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's\nperformance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to\n$182.6\\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,\nCIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\\footnote{Code is anonymously available at\n\\href{https://github.com/youbin2014/UCAN/}{https://github.com/youbin2014/UCAN/}}"}

They produce relational\nrepresentations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well\nas incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be\nmore limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation\nand linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid\napproach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with\nthe symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational\nrepresentations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for\nrephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source\nof information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic\nNLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for\nincremental learning.

However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,\nany-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right\nsampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.\nAt inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked\npositions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute\nwhen left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order\ndecoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs\nto infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish\nbetween reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer\nuncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an\nanswer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the\nMDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new\nsource of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that\nfine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a\nperformance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.\nAdditionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for\nscoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,\nwe propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that\nminimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the\nconditional entropies of those positions.

We\nrigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of\nentropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously\nactivated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature\nlevels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we\nhighlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs\nusing the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find\nthat all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,\n16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart\nDRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,\nrespectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of\nsimultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and\nconditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.\nFor example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row\nactivation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,\nincreasing the temperature from 50{\\deg}C to 90{\\deg}C decreases SiMRA's\nentropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation.

To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a\nuniversal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal\nContext Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping\nto capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive\nFine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and\nimplicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights\nfor each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal\nbit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry\ncompression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets\nconfirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression.

In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that\nthe forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the\nforecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy.

In practice,\nhowever, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from\nfinite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance\nmatrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nrobust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for\nuncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix.

Experiments on HotpotQA\n(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1\ngains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high\nefficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic\nunification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and\nKGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that\nreduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and\n(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency\nand auditability."}

Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically\nreactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to\nsuboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper\ninvestigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request\nrouting by anticipating application latency.

We propose a bidirectional concept distillation\nframework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).\nOur approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step\ndiffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained\nsimultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the\nstudent, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the\nEchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure\nconsistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is\noptimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and\nwith alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.\nFurthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,\nwherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to\nfeedback to the teacher model.

Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can\nbe seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines.

These are often modeled using infinite classes of objectives,\ne.g., $L_p$ norms over group distances induced by feasible solutions in a fixed\ndomain. Traditionally, the literature has considered explicitly balancing\n`equity' (or min-max) and `efficiency' (or min-sum) objectives to capture this\ntrade-off. However, the structure of solutions obtained by such modeling\nchoices can be very different. Taking a solution-centric approach, we introduce\nthe concept of provably small set of solutions $P$, called a {\\it portfolio},\nsuch that for every objective function $h(\\cdot)$ in the given class\n$\\mathbf{C}$, there exists some solution in $P$ which is an\n$\\alpha$-approximation for $h(\\cdot)$. Constructing such portfolios can help\ndecision-makers understand the impact of balancing across multiple objectives.\n  Given a finite set of base objectives $h_1, \\ldots, h_N$, we give provable\nalgorithms for constructing portfolios for (1) the class of conic combinations\n$\\mathbf{C} = \\{\\sum_{j \\in [N]}\\lambda_j h_j: \\lambda \\ge 0\\}$ and for (2) any\nclass $\\mathbf{C}$ of functions that interpolates monotonically between the\nmin-sum efficiency objective (i.e., $h_1 + \\ldots + h_N$) and the min-max\nequity objective (i.e., $\\max_{j \\in [N]} h_j$). Examples of the latter are\n$L_p$ norms and top-$\\ell$ norms. As an application, we study the Fair\nSubsidized Facility Location (FSFL) problem, motivated by the crisis of medical\ndeserts caused due to pharmacy closures. FSFL allows subsidizing facilities in\nunderserved areas using revenue from profitable locations. We develop a novel\nbicriteria approximation algorithm and show a significant reduction of medical\ndeserts across states in the U.S."}

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic.

In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on\nKLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to\njoint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based\ninformation increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.\nFurthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives\nand observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier\ntrained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational\nlower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound\nis tight when applied to MI estimation.

To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens.

By representing both\ninput camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,\nCupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that\nproduces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;\nand (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to\nenhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3\ndB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching\nmonocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity\nover baseline 3D generative models.

We show: (1) $F_{2}(2,s,s)=O(s\\log s)$ by\nperforming controlled planar geometric transformations and constructing an\nauxiliary graph whose planarity yields the upper bound; (2) when $s$ is large,\n$F_r(d,s,\\ldots,s)$ can be bounded by\n$O_{r,d}(s^{(1-\\frac{1}{2^{d}(d+1)})r+1})$ and $O_{d}(r^{3}\\log r\\cdot\ns^{2d+3})$, respectively. This builds on a novel connection between the\ngeometric obstruction and hypergraph Tur\\'{a}n numbers, in particular, a\nvariant of the Erd\\H{o}s box problem."}

This paper implements a novel Bayesian\ngraph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a\nprimordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a\nspherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to\nrespect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To\nadvance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty\nquantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the\nframework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the\nmodel confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates\nexceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the\nmagnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty\nestimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and\nGPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate\nparameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides\nreliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust\ncosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology."}
