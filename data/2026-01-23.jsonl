Despite these advances, a substantial gap remains between RL research and its deployment in many practical settings. Two recurring challenges often underlie this gap. First, many settings offer limited opportunity for the agent to interact extensively with the target environment due to practical constraints. Second, many target environments often undergo substantial changes, requiring redesign and redeployment of RL systems (e.g., advancements in science and technology that change the landscape of healthcare delivery). Addressing these challenges and bridging the gap between basic research and application requires theory and methodology that directly inform the design, implementation, and continual improvement of RL systems in real-world settings.\n  In this paper, we frame the application of RL in practice as a three-component process: (i) online learning and optimization during deployment, (ii) post- or between-deployment offline analyses, and (iii) repeated cycles of deployment and redeployment to continually improve the RL system. We provide a narrative review of recent advances in statistical RL that address these components, including methods for maximizing data utility for between-deployment inference, enhancing sample efficiency for online learning within-deployment, and designing sequences of deployments for continual improvement. We also outline future research directions in statistical RL that are use-inspired -- aiming for impactful application of RL in practice."}

While the X-Learner framework effectively addresses imbalance through cross-imputation, we demonstrate that it is fundamentally vulnerable to \"Outlier Smearing\" when reliant on Mean Squared Error (MSE) minimization. In this failure mode, the bias from a few extreme observations (\"whales\") in the minority group is propagated to the entire majority group during the imputation step, corrupting the estimated treatment effect structure. To resolve this, we propose the Robust X-Learner (RX-Learner). This framework integrates a redescending γ-divergence objective -- structurally equivalent to the Welsch loss under Gaussian assumptions -- into the gradient boosting machinery. We further stabilize the non-convex optimization using a Proxy Hessian strategy grounded in Majorization-Minimization (MM) principles. Empirical evaluation on a semi-synthetic Criteo Uplift dataset demonstrates that the RX-Learner reduces the Precision in Estimation of Heterogeneous Effect (PEHE) metric by 98.6% compared to the standard X-Learner, effectively decoupling the stable \"Core\" population from the volatile \"Periphery\"."}

SmoothFBO introduces a time-smoothed stochastic hypergradient estimator that reduces variance through a window parameter, enabling stable outer-loop updates with sublinear regret. Importantly, the classical parametric bilevel case is a special reduction of our framework, making SmoothFBO a natural extension to online, non-stationary settings. Empirically, SmoothFBO consistently outperforms existing FBO methods in non-stationary hyperparameter optimization and model-based reinforcement learning, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. Together, these results establish SmoothFBO as a general, theoretically grounded, and practically viable foundation for bilevel optimization in online, non-stationary scenarios."}

Traditional approaches pursue this objective indirectly, for example, via inverse propensity score weighting or by matching a finite number of covariate moments, and therefore do not guarantee balance of the full joint covariate distributions. Recently, distributional balancing methods have emerged as robust, nonparametric alternatives that directly target alignment of entire covariate distributions, but they lack a unified framework, formal theoretical guarantees, and valid inferential procedures. We introduce a unified framework for nonparametric distributional balancing based on the characteristic function distance (CFD) and show that widely used discrepancy measures, including the maximum mean discrepancy and energy distance, arise as special cases. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions under which the resulting CFD-based weighting estimator achieves $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency. Since the standard bootstrap may fail for this estimator, we propose subsampling as a valid alternative for inference. We further extend our approach to an instrumental variable setting to address potential unmeasured confounding. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our method through simulation studies and a real-world application, where the proposed estimator performs well and exhibits results consistent with our theoretical predictions."}

However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious \"cropping-implies-degradation\" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales."}

We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains."}

Clinical imaging modalities are limited: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) captures the root but has a noisy, low-resolution crown, while Intraoral Scanners (IOS) provide a high-fidelity crown but no root information. A naive fusion of these sources results in unnatural seams and artifacts. We propose a novel, fully-automated pipeline that fuses CBCT and IOS data using a deep implicit representation. Our method first segments and robustly registers the tooth instances, then creates a hybrid proxy mesh combining the IOS crown and the CBCT root. The core of our approach is to use this noisy proxy to guide a class-specific DeepSDF network. This optimization process projects the input onto a learned manifold of ideal tooth shapes, generating a seamless, watertight, and anatomically coherent model. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show our method uniquely preserves both the high-fidelity crown from IOS and the patient-specific root morphology from CBCT, overcoming the limitations of each modality and naive stitching."}

However, in the context of infant and child nutritional assessment from body shape images this is a relevant problem. In this setting, classification rules obtained on the shape space from a reference sample cannot be used on out-of-sample individuals in a straightforward way. Indeed, a series of sample dependent processing steps, such as alignment (Procrustes analysis, for instance) or allometric regression, need to be conducted before the classification rule can be applied. This work proposes ways of obtaining shape coordinates for a new individual and analyzes the effect of using different template configurations on the sample of study as target for registration of the out-of-sample raw coordinates. Understanding sample characteristics and collinearity among shape variables is crucial for optimal classification results when evaluating children's nutritional status using arm shape analysis from photos.

However, existing methods still face key issues that make inpainted images look unnatural. In this paper, we identify two main problems: (1) Unwanted object insertion: generative models may hallucinate arbitrary objects in the masked region that do not match the surrounding context. (2) Color inconsistency: inpainted regions often exhibit noticeable color shifts, leading to smeared textures and degraded image quality. We analyze the underlying causes of these issues and propose efficient post-hoc solutions for pre-trained inpainting models. Specifically, we introduce the principled framework of Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior (ASUKA). To reduce unwanted object insertion, we use reconstruction-based priors to guide the generative model, suppressing hallucinated objects while preserving generative flexibility. To address color inconsistency, we design a specialized VAE decoder that formulates latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task. This design significantly reduces color shifts and produces more color-consistent results. We implement ASUKA on two representative inpainting architectures: a U-Net-based model and a DiT-based model. We analyze and propose lightweight injection strategies that minimize interference with the model's original generation capacity while ensuring the mitigation of the two issues. We evaluate ASUKA using the Places2 dataset and MISATO, our proposed diverse benchmark. Experiments show that ASUKA effectively suppresses object hallucination and improves color consistency, outperforming standard diffusion, rectified flow models, and other inpainting methods. Dataset, models and codes will be released in github."}

This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate."}

In this paper, we investigate the degree to which RF automatically adapts to the intrinsic low dimensionality of the support of the target distribution to accelerate sampling. We show that, using a carefully designed choice of the time-discretization scheme and with sufficiently accurate drift estimates, the RF sampler enjoys an iteration complexity of order $O(k/\\varepsilon)$ (up to log factors), where $\\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of\n  the target distribution. In addition, we show that the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) procedure is equivalent to a stochastic version of RF by establishing a novel connection between these processes and stochastic localization. Building on this connection, we further design a stochastic RF sampler that also adapts to the low-dimensionality of the target distribution under milder requirements on the accuracy of the drift estimates, and also with a specific time schedule. We illustrate with simulations on the synthetic data and text-to-image data experiments the improved performance of the proposed samplers implementing the newly designed time-discretization schedules."}

Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet).

In this study, we examine whether selected macroeconomic indicators contain predictive information for several capacity-related public health targets, including employment in the health and social assistance workforce, new business applications in the sector, and health care construction spending. Using monthly U.S. time series data, we evaluate multiple forecasting approaches, including neural network models with different optimization strategies, generalized additive models, random forests, and time series models with exogenous macroeconomic indicators, under alternative model fitting designs. Across evaluation settings, we find that macroeconomic indicators provide a consistent and reproducible predictive signal for some public health targets, particularly workforce and infrastructure measures, while other targets exhibit weaker or less stable predictability. Models emphasizing stability and implicit regularization tend to perform more reliably during periods of economic volatility. These findings suggest that macroeconomic indicators may serve as useful upstream signals for digital public health monitoring, while underscoring the need for careful model selection and validation when translating economic trends into health system forecasting tools."}

Existing methods are often model-based or algorithmic and typically do not incorporate statistical inference to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction outcomes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that transforms the task of contact prediction into a statistical testing problem. Our approach is motivated by the partial correlation for continuous random variables. With one-hot encoding of MSA data, we are able to construct a partial correlation graph for multivariate categorical variables. In this framework, two connected nodes in the graph indicate that the corresponding positions on the protein form a contact. A new spectrum-based test statistic is introduced to test whether two positions are partially correlated. Moreover, the new framework enables the identification of amino acid combinations that contribute to the correlation within the identified contacts, an important but largely unexplored aspect of protein mutations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is valid in terms of controlling Type I errors and powerful in general. Real data applications on various protein families further validate the practical utility of our approach in coevolution and mutation analysis."}

However, most existing acoustic simulators are tailored for indoor environments and are limited to static sound sources, making them unsuitable for scenarios involving moving sources, moving microphones, or long-distance propagation. This paper presents DynamicSound an open-source acoustic simulation framework for generating multichannel audio from one or more sound sources with the possibility to move them continuously in three-dimensional space and recorded by arbitrarily configured microphone arrays. The proposed model explicitly accounts for finite sound propagation delays, Doppler effects, distance-dependent attenuation, air absorption, and first-order reflections from planar surfaces, yielding temporally consistent spatial audio signals. Unlike conventional mono or stereo simulators, the proposed system synthesizes audio for an arbitrary number of virtual microphones, accurately reproducing inter-microphone time delays, level differences, and spectral coloration induced by the environment. Comparative evaluations with existing open-source tools demonstrate that the generated signals preserve high spatial fidelity across varying source positions and acoustic conditions. By enabling the generation of realistic multichannel audio under controlled and repeatable conditions, the proposed open framework provides a flexible and reproducible tool for the development, training, and evaluation of modern spatial audio and sound-source localization algorithms."}

To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces."}

However, theoretical guarantees for these estimates as the system size grows have been lacking. A critical concern is that hyperparameter estimation may diverge for larger networks, undermining the model's reliability. Formulating the system's evolution in a measure transport perspective, we propose a theoretical framework for estimating hyperparameters with mean-type observations, which are prevalent in many scientific applications. Our primary contribution is a nonasymptotic bound for the deviation of estimate of hyperparameters in inhomogeneous complex network dynamical systems with respect to network population size, which is established for a general family of optimization algorithms within a fixed observation duration. While we firstly establish a consistency result for systems with independent nodes, our main result extends this guarantee to the more challenging and realistic setting of weakly-dependent nodes. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on two representative models: a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model and a Spiking Neuronal Network model. In both cases, the results confirm that the estimation error decreases as the network population size increases, aligning with our theoretical guarantees. This research proposes the foundational theory to ensure that hierarchical Bayesian methods are statistically consistent for large-scale inhomogeneous systems, filling a gap in this area of theoretical research and justifying their application in practice."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a robust statistical-CSI-based optimization framework for downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with FIM-assisted transmitters. A block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize power allocation and FIM morphing, maximizing the average achievable sum rate. Simulation results show that the proposed statistical-CSI-driven FIM design significantly outperforms conventional rigid antenna arrays (RAAs), validating its effectiveness and practicality."}

Building on the Age of Actuation (AoA) metric, which quantifies the timeliness of actions independently of data freshness, we introduce a new metric, the \\emph{Age of Actuated Information (AoAI)}. AoAI captures the end-to-end timeliness of actions by explicitly accounting for the age of the data packet at the moment it is actuated. We analyze and characterize both AoA and AoAI in discrete-time systems with data storage capabilities under multiple actuation scenarios. The actuator requires both a data packet and an actuation opportunity, which may be provided by a controller or enabled by harvested energy. Data packets may be stored either in a single-packet buffer or an infinite-capacity queue for future actuation. For these settings, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoA and AoAI and investigate their structural differences. While AoA and AoAI coincide in instantaneous actuation systems, they differentiate when data buffering is present. Our results reveal counterintuitive regimes in which increasing update or actuation rates degrade action timeliness for both AoA and AoAI. Moreover, as part of the analysis, we obtain a novel closed-form characterization of the steady-state distribution of a Geo/Geo/1 queue operating under the FCFS discipline, expressed solely in terms of the queue length and the age of the head-of-line packet. The proposed metrics and analytical results provide new insights into the semantics of timeliness in systems where information ultimately serves the purpose of actuation."}

AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision.

This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems."}

This study evaluates a comprehensive system for preliminary skin lesion assessment that combines the clinically established ABCD rule of dermoscopy (analyzing Asymmetry, Borders, Color, and Dermoscopic Structures) with machine learning classification. Using a 1,000-image subset of the HAM10000 dataset, the system implements an automated, rule-based pipeline to compute a Total Dermoscopy Score (TDS) for each lesion. This handcrafted approach is compared against various machine learning solutions, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and deep learning models. While the rule-based system provides high clinical interpretability, results indicate a performance bottleneck when reducing complex morphology to five numerical features. Experimental findings show that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 failed significantly due to domain shift between natural and medical images. In contrast, a custom three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch achieved 78.5% accuracy and 86.5% recall on median-filtered images, representing a 19-point accuracy improvement over traditional methods.

This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data."}

This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference."}

We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation.

GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages.

Model-based prognostics algorithms rely on a parametric model of the system degradation process. The model parameters are learned from real-time operational data collected on the system. However, there can be valuable information in data from similar systems or components, which is not typically utilized in PHM. In this contribution, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) framework for PHM that integrates both operational data and run-to-failure data from similar systems or components. The HBM framework utilizes hyperparameter distributions learned from data of similar systems or components as priors. It enables efficient updates of predictions as more information becomes available, allowing for increasingly accurate assessments of the degradation process and its associated variability. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through two experimental applications involving real-world data from crack growth and lithium battery degradation. Results show significant improvements in RUL prediction accuracy and demonstrate how the framework facilitates uncertainty management through predictive distributions."}

This paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation. The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing performance."}

The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice."}

Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep \"academic value\", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys.

Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys."}

The natural estimator is the least squares estimator (LSE), which coincides with the Euclidean projection of $Y$ onto $Θ$. We construct an explicit example exhibiting \\emph{risk reversal}: for sufficiently large noise, there exist nested compact convex sets $Θ_S \\subset Θ_L$ and a parameter $θ^\\star \\in Θ_S$ such that the LSE constrained to $Θ_S$ has strictly larger risk than the LSE constrained to $Θ_L$. We further show that this phenomenon can persist at the level of worst-case risk, with the supremum risk over the smaller constraint set exceeding that over the larger one.\n  We clarify this behavior by contrasting noise regimes. In the vanishing-noise limit, the risk admits a first-order expansion governed by the statistical dimension of the tangent cone at $θ^\\star$, and tighter constraints uniformly reduce risk. In contrast, in the diverging-noise regime, the risk is determined by global geometric interactions between the constraint set and random noise directions.

The system's primary objective is to levitate a steel ball using electromagnetic force without physical contact, thereby eliminating frictional losses. A comprehensive state-space model was developed, capturing both the mechanical and electrical dynamics. The equilibrium points of the system were determined through feedback linearization using the Jacobian matrix. To ensure system stability, controllability and observability analyses were conducted, confirming that state feedback and observer-based control strategies could be effectively implemented. Three distinct control methods were explored: pole placement-based state feedback control, full-order observer design, and optimal state feedback control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Each control strategy was validated through Simulink simulations for both linearized and nonlinear models. Simulation results demonstrated that the linearized system consistently achieved desired performance with minimal oscillations, whereas the nonlinear system exhibited significant transient oscillations before stabilization. The full-order observer enhanced estimation accuracy, enabling effective control where direct state measurement was impractical. The LQR-based control offered improved robustness and minimized control effort, though its performance was comparable to standard state feedback in some cases."}

The former have often been criticized as not being fully functional and losing too much information. On the other hand, unlike the latter, they take the covariance structure of the data into account by weighting the CUSUM statistics obtained after dimension reduction with the inverse covariance matrix. In this paper, as a middle ground between these two approaches, we propose an alternative statistic that includes the covariance structure with an offset parameter to produce a scale-invariant test procedure and to increase power when the change is not aligned with the first components. We obtain the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis for this new test statistic, allowing for time dependence of the data. Furthermore, we introduce versions of all three test statistics for gradual change situations, which have not been previously considered for functional data, and derive their limit distribution. Further results shed light on the asymptotic power behavior for all test statistics under various ground truths for the alternatives."}

It specifically explores the challenges demonstrators face with manual, model solution-based grading and how a GenAI-supported system can be designed to reliably identify student errors, provide high-quality feedback, and support human graders. The research also examines human graders' perceptions of the effectiveness of this GenAI-assisted approach. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The study found that GenAI achieved an overall grading accuracy of 92.5%, comparable to two experienced human graders. The two researchers, who also served as subject demonstrators, perceived the GenAI as a helpful second reviewer that improved accuracy by catching small errors and provided more complete feedback than they could manually. A central outcome was the significant enhancement of formative feedback. However, they noted the GenAI tool is not yet reliable enough for autonomous use, especially with unconventional solutions. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study demonstrates that GenAI, when paired with a structured, criterion-referenced framework using binary questions, can grade engineering mathematical assessments with an accuracy comparable to human experts. Its primary contribution is a novel methodological approach that embeds the generation of high-quality, scalable formative feedback directly into the assessment workflow. Future work should investigate student perceptions of GenAI grading and feedback."}

Relevant literature was identified through systematic database searches and hand searches. Analysis of 39 studies revealed four overarching categories of behavior change strategies: coaching strategies, counseling strategies, social influence strategies, and persuasion-enhancing strategies. These strategies highlight the unique affordances of social robots as behavior change interventions and offer valuable design heuristics.

Comforting results show that interpolation indeed may not affect the minimax rate of convergence under the squared error loss. In the mean time, DNNs are well known to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in future inputs. A natural question then arises: Can interpolation also escape from suboptimal performance under a future $X$-attack? In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of interpolating estimators in a framework of nonparametric regression. A finding is that interpolating estimators must be suboptimal even under a subtle future $X$-attack, and achieving perfect fitting can substantially damage their robustness. An interesting phenomenon in the high interpolation regime, which we term the curse of simple size, is also revealed and discussed. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings."}

To enhance efficiency and adaptability, this work proposes an asynchronous communication strategy where each node executes a weight-constrained filtered-x LMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm and independently requests communication only when its local noise reduction performance degrades. Upon request, other nodes transmit the weight difference between their local control filter and the center point in WCFxLMS, which are then integrated to update both the control filter and the center point. This design enables nodes to operate asynchronously while preserving cooperative behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous communication DMCANC (ACDMCANC) system maintains effective noise reduction with significantly reduced communication load, offering improved scalability for heterogeneous networks."}

We use behavior in two canonical economic games to study whether people have different expectations when decisions are made by LLMs acting on their behalf instead of themselves. More specifically, we study the social appropriateness of a spectrum of possible behaviors: when LLMs divide resources on our behalf (Dictator Game and Ultimatum Game) and when they monitor the fairness of splits of resources (Ultimatum Game). We use the Krupka-Weber norm elicitation task to detect shifts in social appropriateness ratings. Results of two pre-registered and incentivized experimental studies using representative samples from the UK and US (N = 2,658) show three key findings. First, people find that offers from machines - when no acceptance is necessary - are judged to be less appropriate than when they come from humans, although there is no shift in the modal response. Second - when acceptance is necessary - it is more appropriate for a person to reject offers from machines than from humans. Third, receiving a rejection of an offer from a machine is no less socially appropriate than receiving the same rejection from a human. Overall, these results suggest that people apply different norms for machines deciding on how to split resources but are not opposed to machines enforcing the norms. The findings are consistent with offers made by machines now being viewed as having both a cognitive and emotional component."}

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift.

In a ``local symmetry\" regime, imbalance is not the dominant source of error near the balanced optimum, so adding synthetic samples cannot improve learning rates and can even degrade performance by amplifying generator mismatch. When augmentation can help (a ``local asymmetry\" regime), the optimal synthetic size depends on generator accuracy and on whether the generator's residual mismatch is directionally aligned with the intrinsic majority-minority shift. This structure can make the best synthetic size deviate from naive full balancing, sometimes by a small refinement and sometimes substantially when generator bias is systematic. Practically, we recommend Validation-Tuned Synthetic Size (VTSS): select the synthetic size by minimizing balanced validation loss over a range centered near the fully balanced baseline, while allowing meaningful departures when the data indicate them. Simulations and a real sepsis prediction study support the theory and illustrate when synthetic augmentation helps, when it cannot, and how to tune its quantity effectively."}

By revisiting the convergence analysis of iterative reconstruction algorithms for non-uniform measurements, we derive a local, energy-based sufficient condition that governs reconstruction behavior as a function of the signal and derivative energies within each sampling interval. Unlike classical approaches that impose a global Nyquist-type bound on the inter-sample spacing, the proposed condition permits large gaps in slowly varying regions while enforcing denser sampling only where the signal exhibits rapid temporal variation. Building on this theoretical insight, we design a variable-bias, variable-threshold integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (VBT-IF-TEM) whose firing mechanism is explicitly shaped to enforce the derived local convergence condition. To ensure robustness, a shifted-signal formulation is introduced to suppress excessive firing in regions where the magnitude of the signal amplitude is close to zero or the local signal energy approaches zero. Using the proposed encoder, an analog signal is discretely represented by time encodings and signal averages, enabling perfect reconstruction via a standard iterative algorithm even when the local sampling rate falls below the Nyquist rate. Simulation results on synthetic signals and experiments on ultrasonic guided-wave and ECG signals demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves substantial reductions in sampling density compared to uniform sampling and conventional IF-TEMs, while maintaining accurate reconstruction. The results further highlight a controllable tradeoff between sampling density, reconstruction accuracy, and convergence behavior, which can be navigated through adaptive parameter selection."}

Given a game with empty core, we look for the closest balanced game, in the sense of the (weighted) Euclidean distance, i.e., the orthogonal projection of the game on the set of balanced games. Besides an analytical approach which becomes rapidly intractable, we propose a fast algorithm to find the closest balanced game, avoiding exponential complexity for the optimization problem, and being able to run up to 20 players. We show experimentally that the probability that the closest game has a core reduced to a singleton tends to 1 when the number of players grow. We provide a mathematical proof that the proportion of facets whose games have a non-singleton core tends to 0 when the number of players grow, by finding an expression of the aymptotic growth of the number of minimal balanced collections. This permits to prove mathematically the experimental result. Consequently, taking the core of the projected game defines a new solution concept, which we call least square core due to its analogy with the least core, and our result shows that the probability that this is a point solution tends to 1 when the number of players grow."}

We propose a principled framework for reliable representation learning that explicitly models representation-level uncertainty and leverages structural constraints as inductive biases to regularize the space of feasible representations. Our approach introduces uncertainty-aware regularization directly in the representation space, encouraging representations that are not only predictive but also stable, well-calibrated, and robust to noise and structural perturbations. Structural constraints, such as sparsity, relational structure, or feature-group dependencies, are incorporated to define meaningful geometry and reduce spurious variability in learned representations, without assuming fully correct or noise-free structure. Importantly, the proposed framework is independent of specific model architectures and can be integrated with a wide range of representation learning methods."}

However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability."}

The core idea behind the proposed scheme lies in mapping the transmitted information bits onto sparse vectors via block and single-element sparse mappings. The block sparse mapping pattern is able to concentrate the transmit power in a small number of non-zero blocks thus improving the decoding accuracy, while the single-element sparse mapping pattern ensures that the code length does not increase dramatically with the number of transmitted information bits. At the receiver, a two-stage decoding algorithm is proposed to sequentially identify non-zero block indexes and single-element non-zero indexes. Extensive simulation results verify that proposed DM-SVC scheme outperforms the existing SVC schemes in terms of block error rate and spectral efficiency."}

We consider the case where the IO signal is available at each receiver node through a reference channel, whereas target returns corrupted by interference are collected in a separate surveillance channel. The problem formulation is similar to an active radar that uses a noise-like waveform, or an integrated sensing and communication application. The available data is first split into batches of manageable size. In the direct approach, the target's time-delay and Doppler parameters are estimated jointly by incoherently combining the batch-wise data. We propose a new method to estimate the time-delay separately, thus avoiding a costly 2-D search. Our approach is designed for slowly moving targets, and the accuracy of the time-delay estimate is similar to that of the full batch-wise 2-D method. Given the time-delay, the coherency between batches can be restored when estimating the Doppler parameter. Thereby, the separable approach is found to yield superior Doppler estimates over a wide parameter range. In addition to reducing computational complexity, the proposed separable estimation technique also significantly reduces the communication overhead in a distributed radar setting."}

To support flexible spatial processing and meet the demands of latency critical applications, it is essential to use fully digital mmWave MIMO beamforming, which relies on accurate channel estimation. However, ensuring power efficiency in fully digital mmWave MIMO systems requires the use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The reduced resolution of these quantizers introduces distortion in both transmitted and received signals, ultimately degrading system performance.

Success thus depends on efficiently allocating limited resources. However, empirical demonstration has been difficult because effort allocation is rarely observable and feedback is often delayed, limiting our understanding of expertise. Professional tennis provides an ideal natural experiment. Because each game resets after a player wins four points and points in a lost game are wasted, the value of a point varies sharply across scores. Efficient allocation should therefore win games without wasting points, conserving resources for future games. Such allocation manifests in score-dependent point-winning probabilities, from which we derive each player's Pareto frontier-the theoretical limit of the trade-off between game-winning probability and the expected points per game. Here, we show that top players operate closer to this frontier, converting points to game wins more efficiently. Optimal strategies reduce the probability of winning points when the player is far behind (e.g.,0-2, 0-3). This behavior is psychologically difficult-letting go of the current game-but represents a rational energy conservation strategy. Top players exhibit this pattern especially in return games, where winning points is harder than in service games, requiring them to drastically vary their efforts, consistent with game-theoretic predictions. These findings suggest that elite performance reflects efficient adaptation to rule-created value structures; knowing when to give up may be as fundamental to expertise as knowing when to compete."}

We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.\n  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data.

Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts.

To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD."}

An increasingly prominent approach to studying community structure in temporal networks is statistical inference. In the present paper, we study the performance of a class of statistical-inference methods for community detection in temporal networks. We represent temporal networks as multilayer networks, with each layer encoding a time step, and we illustrate that statistical-inference models that generate community assignments via either a uniform distribution on community assignments or discrete-time Markov processes are biased against generating communities with large or small numbers of nodes. In particular, we demonstrate that statistical-inference methods that use such generative models tend to poorly identify community structure in networks with large or small communities. To rectify this issue, we introduce a novel statistical model that generates the community assignments of the nodes in given layer (i.e., at a given time) using all of the community assignments in the previous layer. We prove results that guarantee that our approach greatly mitigates the bias against large and small communities, so using our generative model is beneficial for studying community structure in networks with large or small communities.

The performance of PD array-based systems is compared, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and achievable rate, to that of a reference receiver employing a single PD. Analytical and numerical results show that PD arrays provide performance gains for sufficiently narrow beams and above an SNR threshold.

But whether they believe themselves to be sentient can, in principle, be tested. We do so by querying several open-weights models about their own consciousness, and then verifying their responses using classifiers trained on internal activations. We draw upon three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) ranging from 0.6 billion to 70 billion parameters, approximately 50 questions about consciousness and subjective experience, and three classification methods from the interpretability literature. First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves. Second, classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs - rather than mere outputs - provide no clear evidence that these denials are untruthful. Third, within the Qwen family, larger models deny sentience more confidently than smaller ones. These findings contrast with recent work suggesting that models harbour latent beliefs in their own consciousness."}

Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference.\n  We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions."}

Tool-calling extends LLMs with the ability to interact with external APIs, greatly enhancing their practical utility. While prior research has improved tool-calling performance by adopting traditional computer systems techniques, such as parallel and asynchronous execution, the challenge of redundant or repeated tool-calling requests remains largely unaddressed. Caching is a classic solution to this problem, but applying it to LLM tool-calling introduces new difficulties due to heterogeneous request semantics, dynamic workloads, and varying freshness requirements, which render conventional cache policies ineffective. To address these issues, we propose ToolCaching, an efficient feature-driven and adaptive caching framework for LLM tool-calling systems. ToolCaching systematically integrates semantic and system-level features to evaluate request cacheability and estimate caching value. At its core, the VAAC algorithm integrates bandit-based admission with value-driven, multi-factor eviction, jointly accounting for request frequency, recency, and caching value. Extensive experiments on synthetic and public tool-calling workloads demonstrate that ToolCaching with VAAC achieves up to 11% higher cache hit ratios and 34% lower latency compared to standard policies, effectively accelerating LLM tool-calling in practical applications."}

We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages.

The final score of each player is defined as the sum of the scores obtained in matches against all other players.

The decoding is performed using the traditional multipath matching pursuit algorithm, and the overall complexity is significantly reduced by exploiting the sparsity of the codebook. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a favorable trade-off between BLER performance and computational complexity, and exhibits strong robustness across different transmission block lengths."}

Extending an ensemble-based open coding approach with an LLM moderator, we add an axial coding step that groups open codes into higher-order categories, transforming raw debate transcripts into concise, hierarchical representations. We compare two strategies: (i) clustering embeddings of code-utterance pairs using density-based and partitioning algorithms followed by LLM labeling, and (ii) direct LLM-based grouping of codes and utterances into categories. We apply our method to Dutch parliamentary debates, converting lengthy transcripts into compact, hierarchically structured codes and categories. We evaluate our method using extrinsic metrics aligned with human-assigned topic labels (ROUGE-L, cosine, BERTScore), and intrinsic metrics describing code groups (coverage, brevity, coherence, novelty, JSD divergence). Our results reveal a trade-off: density-based clustering achieves high coverage and strong cluster alignment, while direct LLM grouping results in higher fine-grained alignment, but lower coverage 20%. Overall, clustering maximizes coverage and structural separation, whereas LLM grouping produces more concise, interpretable, and semantically aligned categories.

Starting from an a priori bound on the orbit of iterates, we derive non-asymptotic estimates for the fixed-point residuals. These bounds are tight, meaning that they are attained by a suitable Lipschitz map and an associated Halpern sequence. By minimizing these tight bounds we identify the minimax-optimal Halpern scheme. For contractions, the optimal iteration exhibits a transition from an initial Halpern phase to the classical Banach-Picard iteration and, as the Lipschitz constant approaches one, we recover the known convergence rate for nonexpansive maps. For expansive maps, the algorithm is purely Halpern with no Banach-Picard phase; moreover, on bounded domains, the residual estimates converge to the minimal displacement bound. Inspired by the minimax-optimal iteration, we design an adaptive scheme whose residuals are uniformly smaller than the minimax-optimal bounds, and can be significantly sharper in practice. Finally, we extend the analysis by introducing alternative bounds based on the distance to a fixed point, which allow us to handle mappings on unbounded domains; including the case of affine maps for which we also identify the minimax-optimal iteration."}

Given the recent trend of \\emph{scaling up} models to larger numbers of parameters and training samples, a very important question is how unconstrained MLIPs behave in this limit. Here we investigate this issue, showing that -- when trained on large datasets -- unconstrained models can be superior in accuracy and speed when compared to physically constrained models. We assess these models both in terms of benchmark accuracy and in terms of usability in practical scenarios, focusing on static simulation workflows such as geometry optimization and lattice dynamics.

In this work, we introduce DS2ST-LM, a scalable, single-stage direct S2ST framework leveraging a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture integrates a Whisper speech encoder, a learnable projection module, a Qwen2-0.5B LLM, and a timbre-controlled vocoder. We construct GigaS2S-1000, a 1000-hour bilingual corpus by extending the GigaST dataset with high-fidelity synthetic target speech, and show that this synthetic data alleviates data scarcity to some extent. We investigate two semantic token generation strategies: speech-derived S3 tokens and text-derived tokens generated by a pre-trained LLM, and analyze their impact on training stability and semantic consistency. We further evaluate three projection architectures (Linear, Conv1D-Linear, and Q-Former) and observe that while higher-capacity projectors converge faster, the simple Linear projector achieves higher performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS2ST-LM outperforms traditional cascaded and ST (Qwen-Audio) + TTS baselines across both lexical (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic (BLEURT, COMET) metrics, while extending to multiple language pairs, including French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu.

Rather than simply muting or replacing a single word, our approach transforms the tone, intensity, and sentiment, thus not altering just the lyrics, but how it is expressed. We present a comparative analysis of four selected English songs and their transformed counterparts, evaluating changes through both acoustic and sentiment-based lenses. Our findings indicate that Gen-AI significantly reduces vocal aggressiveness, with acoustic analysis showing improvements in Harmonic to Noise Ratio, Cepstral Peak Prominence, and Shimmer. Sentiment analysis reduced aggression by 63.3-85.6\\% across artists, with major improvements in chorus sections (up to 88.6\\% reduction). The transformed versions maintained musical coherence while mitigating harmful content, offering a promising alternative to traditional content moderation that avoids triggering the \"forbidden fruit\" effect, where the censored content becomes more appealing simply because it is restricted. This approach demonstrates the potential for GenAI to create safer listening experiences while preserving artistic expression."}

At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces."}

A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging spectral priors in both feature representation and supervision, paving the way for generalized segmentation frameworks that excel in fine-grained object localization."}

They can easily lead to infinite loops or executions, exhaust resources, or introduce logical errors that degrade performance and compromise security. The problem are often undetected by traditional static analyzers because such tools rely on syntactic patterns, which makes them struggle to detect semantic flaws. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for vulnerability detection because of their ability to understand code contextually. Moreover, local LLMs unlike commercial ones like ChatGPT or Gemini addresses issues such as privacy, latency, and dependency concerns by facilitating efficient offline analysis. Consequently, this study proposes a prompt-based framework that utilize local LLMs for the detection of loop vulnerabilities within Python 3.7+ code. The framework targets three categories of loop-related issues, such as control and logic errors, security risks inside loops, and resource management inefficiencies. A generalized and structured prompt-based framework was designed and tested with two locally deployed LLMs (LLaMA 3.2; 3B and Phi 3.5; 4B) by guiding their behavior via iterative prompting. The designed prompt-based framework included key safeguarding features such as language-specific awareness, code-aware grounding, version sensitivity, and hallucination prevention. The LLM results were validated against a manually established baseline truth, and the results indicate that Phi outperforms LLaMA in precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings emphasize the importance of designing effective prompts for local LLMs to perform secure and accurate code vulnerability analysis."}

Thus, spatial and spectral information can be jointly exploited, while at the same time allowing for speakers speaking from different positions. Experiments on the LibriCSS data set with simulated speaker position changes show great improvements over tightly coupled subsystems."}

In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.\n  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics."}

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing."}

In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates the uncertainty arising from both process and measurement noise, and synthesizes controllers that adapt to the level of uncertainty. The framework admits closed-form solutions in linear settings, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on systems whose state spaces range from Euclidean space to Lie groups."}

In this paper, we introduce DeepASMR, the first framework designed for zero-shot ASMR generation. We demonstrate that a single short snippet of a speaker's ordinary, read-style speech is sufficient to synthesize high-fidelity ASMR in their voice, eliminating the need for whispered training data from the target speaker. Methodologically, we first identify that discrete speech tokens provide a soft factorization of ASMR style from speaker timbre. Leveraging this insight, we propose a two-stage pipeline incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) for content-style encoding and a flow-matching acoustic decoder for timbre reconstruction. Furthermore, we contribute DeepASMR-DB, a comprehensive 670-hour English-Chinese multi-speaker ASMR speech corpus, and introduce a novel evaluation protocol integrating objective metrics, human listening tests, LLM-based scoring and unvoiced speech analysis.

Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation.

PF-D2M is trained with a progressive training strategy that effectively addresses data scarcity and generalization challenges. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that PF-D2M achieves state-of-the-art performance in dance-music alignment and music quality."}

The task boils down to selecting the optimal number of nodes for a given job. We present a surrogate-assisted multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to automate this complex decision. Our core hypothesis is that surrogate models informed by attention-based embeddings of job telemetry can capture performance dynamics more effectively than standard regression techniques. We pair this with an intelligent sample acquisition strategy to ensure the approach is data-efficient. On two production HPC datasets, our embedding-informed method consistently identified higher-quality Pareto fronts of runtime-power trade-offs compared to baselines. Furthermore, our intelligent data sampling strategy drastically reduced training costs while improving the stability of the results. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply embedding-informed surrogates in a MOBO framework to the HPC scheduling problem, jointly optimizing for performance and power on production workloads."}

It is essential for privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning, medical diagnosis, and financial data analysis. In popular HE schemes, ciphertext multiplication is only defined for two inputs. However, the multiplication of multiple inputs is needed in many HE applications. In our previous work, a three-input ciphertext multiplication method for the CKKS HE scheme was developed. This paper first reformulates the three-input ciphertext multiplication to enable the combination of computations in order to further reduce the complexity. The second contribution is extending the multiplication to multiple inputs without compromising the noise overhead. Additional evaluation keys are introduced to achieve relinearization of polynomial multiplication results. To minimize the complexity of the large number of rescaling units in the multiplier, a theoretical analysis is developed to relocate the rescaling, and a multi-level rescaling approach is proposed to implement combined rescaling with complexity similar to that of a single rescaling unit. Guidelines and examples are provided on the input partition to enable the combination of more rescaling. Additionally, efficient hardware architectures are designed to implement our proposed multipliers. The improved three-input ciphertext multiplier reduces the logic area and latency by 15% and 50%, respectively, compared to the best prior design. For multipliers with more inputs, ranging from 4 to 12, the architectural analysis reveals 32% savings in area and 45% shorter latency, on average, compared to prior work."}

Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame.

These early-access information bits enable more effective early termination, which is particularly valuable for blind decoding in downlink control channels, where user equipment (UE) must process multiple candidates, many of which carry no valid control information. Our results show that PPP codes offer substantial performance gains over conventional polar codes, particularly at larger block lengths where hardware limitations restrict straightforward scaling. Compared with existing methods such as aggregation or segmentation, PPP codes achieve higher efficiency without the need for additional hardware support. Finally, we propose several frozen-bitmap design strategies tailored to PPP codes."}

This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing."}

Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings."}

Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms."}

This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models."}

Yet its core tenets, including researcher reflexivity, tangible analytical evolution, and productive disagreement, are often poorly supported by software tools that prioritize speed and consensus over interpretive depth. To address this gap, we introduce Reflexis, a collaborative workspace that centers these practices. It supports reflexivity by integrating in-situ reflection prompts, makes code evolution transparent and tangible, and scaffolds collaborative interpretation by turning differences into productive, positionality-aware dialogue. Results from our paired-analyst study (N=12) indicate that Reflexis encouraged participants toward more granular reflection and reframed disagreements as productive conversations. The evaluation also surfaced key design tensions, including a desire for higher-level, networked memos and more user control over the timing of proactive alerts. Reflexis contributes a design framework for tools that prioritize rigor and transparency to support deep, collaborative interpretation in an age of automation."}

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy."}

However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks."}

By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining analytical precision with machine learning algorithms to enhance the precision and reliability of robotic systems."}

This paper surveys the development and mathematical foundations, in particular, regarding bounds and constructions of rank-metric codes, emphasizing their extension beyond finite fields to more general settings. We examine Singleton-like bounds on code parameters, demonstrating their sharpness in finite field cases and contrasting this with contexts where the bounds are not tight.

Thus, a motivational tension that is not informed by needs alone, but also by emotions, intention, goals and means to achieve them is therefore generated within the mental, emotional and physical plane. Based on Montserrat's opinion (2004: 131), that \"to motivate means, above all, to move and to transmit an emotion\", we will undertake to identify the mutual influences between emotions and motivation. The main objectives of this article are to display a summary of the theories and definitions about emotions and to explore the links between emotions and motivation. Although interconnected, emotions and motivation can be contemplated from a double perspective: (1) emotions influence motivation and (2) motivation influences emotions. Moreover, we will consider motivation from three dimensions: (1) cognitive, (2) affective and (3) volitional. The ultimate purpose of this article is to issue a warning as to the importance of the emotional side of motivation.

In particular, for $(X,d)$, let $k$ be the size of the smallest subset of $X$ such that all but that subset (i.e. the ``outlier set'') can be probabilistically embedded into the space of HSTs with expected distortion at most $c$. Our primary result is showing that there exists an efficient algorithm that takes in $(X,d)$ and a target distortion $c$ and samples from a probabilistic embedding with at most $O(\\frac k ε\\log^2k)$ outliers and distortion at most $(32+ε)c$, for any $ε>0$. This leads to better instance-specific approximations for certain instances of the buy-at-bulk and dial-a-ride problems, whose current best approximation algorithms go through HST embeddings.\n  In order to facilitate our results, we largely focus on the concept of compositions of nested embeddings introduced by [Chawla and Sheridan 2024]. A nested embedding is a composition of two embeddings of a metric space $(X,d)$ -- a low distortion embedding of a subset $S$ of nodes, and a higher distortion embedding of the entire metric. The composition is a single embedding that preserves the low distortion over $S$ and does not increase distortion over the remaining points by much. In this paper, we expand this concept from the setting of deterministic embeddings to the setting of probabilistic embeddings. We show how to find good nested compositions of embeddings into HSTs, and combine this with an approximation algorithm of [Munagala et al. 2023] to obtain our results."}

Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios.

To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning.

Our results also extend to nearly-equal-pay contracts where any two payments are identical up to a constant factor.\n  We provide both algorithmic and hardness results across a broad hierarchy of reward functions, under both binary and combinatorial action models. While we focus on equal-pay contracts, our analysis also yields new insights into unconstrained contract design, and resolves two important open problems. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time O(1)-approximation algorithms for (i) submodular rewards under combinatorial actions, and (ii) XOS rewards under binary actions. These guarantees are tight: We rule out the existence of (i) a PTAS for combinatorial actions, even for gross substitutes rewards (unless P = NP), and (ii) any O(1)-approximation for XOS rewards with combinatorial actions. Crucially, our hardness results hold even for unconstrained contracts, thereby settling the corresponding open problems in this setting.\n  Finally, we quantify the loss induced by fairness via the price of equality, defined as the worst-case ratio between the optimal principal's utility achievable by unconstrained contracts and that achievable by equal-pay contracts. We obtain a bound of $Θ(\\log n/ \\log \\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of agents.

This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged.

Comparing Political Framing in Wikipedia and Grokipedia on Controversial Topics", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Online encyclopedias are central to contemporary information infrastructures and have become focal points of debates over ideological bias. Wikipedia, in particular, has long been accused of left-leaning bias, while Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia launched by xAI, has been framed as a right-leaning alternative. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia on well-established politically contested topics. Specifically, we examine differences in semantic framing, political orientation, and content prioritization. We find that semantic similarity between the two platforms decays across article sections and diverges more strongly on controversial topics than on randomly sampled ones. Additionally, we show that both encyclopedias predominantly exhibit left-leaning framings, although Grokipedia exhibits a more bimodal distribution with increased prominence of right-leaning content. The experimental code is publicly available."}

Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly diffusing into scientific practice, holding substantial promise while raising widespread concerns. Despite growing attention to AI use in scientific writing and evaluation, little is known about how the rise of LLMs is reshaping the public funding landscape. Here, we examine LLM involvement at key stages of the federal funding pipeline by combining two complementary data sources: confidential National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal submissions from two large US R1 universities, including funded, unfunded, and pending proposals, and the full population of publicly released NSF and NIH awards. We find that LLM use rises sharply beginning in 2023 and exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating a clear split between minimal and substantive use. Across both private submissions and public awards, higher LLM involvement is consistently associated with lower semantic distinctiveness, positioning projects closer to recently funded work within the same agency. The consequences of this shift are agency-dependent. LLM use is positively associated with proposal success and higher subsequent publication output at NIH, whereas no comparable associations are observed at NSF. Notably, the productivity gains at NIH are concentrated in non-hit papers rather than the most highly cited work. Together, these findings provide large-scale evidence that the rise of LLMs is reshaping how scientific ideas are positioned, selected, and translated into publicly funded research, with implications for portfolio governance, research diversity, and the long-run impact of science."}

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control."}

Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems."}

MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing prompting-based strategies: MPT achieves the lowest bias while maintaining core reasoning ability."}

Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI."}

These libraries are complex and contain bugs. Researchers have proposed various bug-finding techniques for such libraries. Yet, there is much room for improvement. A key challenge in testing DL libraries is the lack of API specifications. Prior testing approaches often inaccurately model the input specifications of DL APIs, resulting in missed valid inputs that could reveal bugs or false alarms due to invalid inputs.\n  To address this challenge, we develop Centaur -- the first neurosymbolic technique to test DL library APIs using dynamically learned input constraints. Centaur leverages the key idea that formal API constraints can be learned from a small number of automatically generated seed inputs, and that the learned constraints can be solved using SMT solvers to generate valid and diverse test inputs.\n  We develop a novel grammar that represents first-order logic formulae over API parameters and expresses tensor-related properties (e.g., shape, data types) as well as relational properties between parameters. We use the grammar to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to enumerate syntactically correct candidate rules, validated using seed inputs. Further, we develop a custom refinement strategy to prune the set of learned rules to eliminate spurious or redundant rules. We use the learned constraints to systematically generate valid and diverse inputs by integrating SMT-based solving with randomized sampling.\n  We evaluate Centaur for testing PyTorch and TensorFlow. Our results show that Centaur's constraints have a recall of 94.0% and a precision of 94.0% on average. In terms of coverage, Centaur covers 203, 150, and 9,608 more branches than TitanFuzz, ACETest and Pathfinder, respectively. Using Centaur, we also detect 26 new bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 18 of which are confirmed."}

However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning."}

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks."}

Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers."}

We generalize this induced-channel viewpoint to arbitrary stabilizer codes used purely as channel transforms. Given any $ [\\![ n, k ]\\!] $ stabilizer generator set, we construct a full symplectic tableau, compute the induced joint distribution of logical Pauli errors and syndromes under the physical Pauli channel, and obtain an achievable rate via a hashing bound with decoder side information. We perform a structured search over small transforms and report instances that improve the baseline hashing bound for a family of Pauli channels with skewed and independent errors studied in prior work."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications.

Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.\n  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications."}

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision.

However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challeng- ing in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links. We validate the performance of both algorithms through simulation"}

Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight."}

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge."}

We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction."}

This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA."}

A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic."}

We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs."}

We evaluate PromptHelper in a 2x2 fully within-subjects study (N=32) across creative and academic writing tasks. Results show that PromptHelper significantly increases users' perceived exploration and expressiveness without increasing cognitive workload.

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems."}

However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios."}

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory."}

We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require \"backward information\" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages.

Existing approaches based on ERC404 style hybrid token models rely on frequent minting and burning during asset transfers, which disrupt token identity continuity and increase on chain overhead. This paper proposes the Semi Fungible Token Lock (SFT Lock) method, a lock/unlock based mechanism that preserves NFT identity and historical traceability while enabling fractional ownership and transferability. By replacing mint/burn operations with deterministic state transitions, SFT Lock ensures consistent lifecycle representation of spectrum assets and significantly reduces on chain operations. Based on this mechanism, a modular smart contract architecture is designed to support spectrum authorization, securitization, and sharing, and a staking mechanism is introduced to enhance asset liquidity. Experimental results on a private Ethereum network demonstrate that, compared with ERC404 style hybrid token models, the proposed method achieves substantial gas savings while maintaining functional correctness and traceability."}

To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace. Extensive experiments on the AI4Privacy PII-Masking dataset using Pythia models demonstrate that our method effectively removes target PII while maintaining model utility."}

Recently developed ternary spiking neuron possesses higher consistency with biological principles (i.e. excitation-inhibition balance mechanism). Despite of this, the ternary spiking neuron suffers from defects including iterative information loss, temporal gradient vanishing and irregular distributions of membrane potentials. To address these issues, we propose Complemented Ternary Spiking Neuron (CTSN), a novel ternary spiking neuron model that incorporates an learnable complemental term to store information from historical inputs. CTSN effectively improves the deficiencies of ternary spiking neuron, while the embedded learnable factors enable CTSN to adaptively adjust neuron dynamics, providing strong neural heterogeneity. Furthermore, based on the temporal evolution features of ternary spiking neurons' membrane potential distributions, we propose the Temporal Membrane Potential Regularization (TMPR) training method. TMPR introduces time-varying regularization strategy utilizing membrane potentials, furhter enhancing the training process by creating extra backpropagation paths.

To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability.

Social robots have shown promise in reducing anxiety through emotional support, yet how such systems should balance psychological safety with effective instructional guidance remains an open question. In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative. Quantitative measures further showed significant reductions in interview-related social and communication anxiety, while maintaining high perceived warmth and therapeutic alliance. We synthesize these findings into an Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem framework, highlighting user agency as a key mechanism for balancing emotional support and instructional guidance in social robot coaching systems."}

To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent).

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking."}

We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network. Empirical evaluations validate that our strategies can effectively improve generalization."}

To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability.

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents."}

UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains."}

A virtualized environment usually deploys a virtual switch within the host system to enable virtual machines to communicate with each other and with the physical network. The Open vSwitch (OVS) is one of the most popular software-based virtual switches. It maintains a cache hierarchy to accelerate packet forwarding from the host to virtual machines. We characterize the caching system inside OVS from a security perspective and identify three attack primitives. Based on the attack primitives, we present three remote attacks via OVS, breaking the isolation in virtualized environments. First, we identify remote covert channels using different caches. Second, we present a novel header recovery attack that leaks a remote user's packet header fields, breaking the confidentiality guarantees from the system. Third, we demonstrate a remote packet rate monitoring attack that recovers the packet rate of a remote victim. To defend against these attacks, we also discuss and evaluate mitigation solutions."}

Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\\sim 3.4\\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\\sim1.3\\times$ at small radius to $\\sim2.0\\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations. Throughout the experimental evaluation, we also identify the simulation cases were regular GPU computation should still be preferred, contributing to the understanding of the strengths and limitations of RT cores."}

Efficient statistical models focus on coarse communication-centric metrics, and therefore miss the weak but critical multipath signatures for sensing, whereas deterministic models are computationally inefficient to scale for system-level ISAC evaluation. This gap calls for a unifying abstraction that can couple what the environment means for sensing with how the channel behaves for communication, namely, environmental semantics. This article clarifies the meaning and essentiality of environmental semantics in ISAC channel modeling and establishes how semantics is connected to observable channel structures across multiple semantic levels. Based on this perspective, a semantics-oriented channel modeling principle was advocated, which preserves environmental semantics while abstracting unnecessary detail to balance accuracy and complexity. Then, a generative AI-empowered semantic twin channel model (STCM) was introduced to generate a family of physically plausible channel realizations representative of a semantic condition. Case studies further show semantic consistency under challenging multi-view settings, suggesting a practical path to controllable simulation, dataset generation, and reproducible ISAC benchmarking toward future design and standardization."}

However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks."}

Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction.

Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models."}

We implemented embodied journaling in virtual reality and conducted a within-subject user study (n=20) to explore the emergent behaviours from the process and to compare its expressive and reflective qualities to those of written journaling. When writing-based norms and affordances were absent, we found that participants defaulted towards unfiltered emotional expression, often forgoing words altogether.

We discuss both the capabilities and pitfalls of embodied journaling, ultimately challenging the idea that reflection culminates in linguistic reasoning."}

At each stage, the student is trained with a specific distillation method, while a frozen reference model from the previous stage anchors learned knowledge to mitigate forgetting. In addition, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism based on the teacher true class probability (TCP) that dynamically adjusts the reference loss per sample to balance knowledge retention and integration.\n  By design, SMSKD supports arbitrary method combinations and stage counts with negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that SMSKD consistently improves student accuracy across diverse teacher student architectures and method combinations, outperforming existing baselines.

In this work, we take the first step to reformulate SER as a deep reasoning problem through reinforcement learning (RL). We propose EmotionThinker, which is designed to generate accurate emotion predictions with interpretable explanations grounded in fine-grained acoustic cues. To achieve this, we first construct EmotionCoT-35K, an emotional reasoning dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations and detailed captions.

However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies. Our work reveals significant security gaps and highlights the pressing need for stronger safeguards for RAG."}

A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks.

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

PDP is commonly considered in two variants: \\textit{bounded} and \\textit{unbounded} PDP. In bounded PDP, the privacy budgets are public and neighboring datasets differ by replacing one record. In unbounded PDP, neighboring datasets differ by adding or removing a record; consequently, an algorithm must additionally protect participation information, making both the dataset size and the privacy profile sensitive. Existing works have only studied mean estimation over bounded distributions under bounded PDP. Different from mean estimation for distributions with bounded range, where each element can be treated equally and we only need to consider the privacy diversity of elements, the challenge for Gaussian is that, elements can have very different contributions due to the unbounded support. we need to jointly consider the privacy information and the data values. Such a problem becomes even more challenging under unbounded PDP, where the privacy information is protected and the way to compute the weights becomes unclear. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing optimal Gaussian mean estimators under both bounded and unbounded PDP, where in each setting we first derive lower bounds for both problems, following PDP mean estimators with the algorithmic upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bounds up to logarithmic factors."}

In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit \"hard writes\" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style \"hard preservation\" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks."}

Prior work largely treats TAP as service-level prediction from natural language, which often yields non-executable applets that still require manual configuration. We study the function-level configuration problem: generating complete applets with correct ingredient-to-field bindings. We propose FARM (Field-Aware Resolution Model), a two-stage architecture for automated applet generation with full configuration. Stage 1 trains contrastive dual encoders with selective layer freezing over schema-enriched representations, retrieving candidates from 1,724 trigger functions and 1,287 action functions (2.2M possible trigger-action pairs). Stage 2 performs selection and configuration using an LLM-based multi-agent pipeline. It includes intent analysis, trigger selection, action selection via cross-schema scoring, and configuration verification. Agents coordinate through shared state and agreement-based selection. FARM achieves 81% joint accuracy on Gold (62% Noisy, 70% One-shot) at the function level, where both trigger and action functions must match the ground truth. For comparison with service-level baselines, we map functions to their parent services and evaluate at the service level. FARM reaches 81% joint accuracy and improves over TARGE by 23 percentage points. FARM also generates ingredient-to-field bindings, producing executable automation configurations."}

Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents."}

This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots."}

Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement.

To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark. It also improves execution accuracy, reaching a state-of-the-art accuracy of 44.8% on the Spider 2.0 Lite benchmark."}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths.

In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

In this paper, we introduce a novel zkFinGPT scheme that applies zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to high-value financial use cases, enabling verification while protecting data privacy. We describe how zkFinGPT will be applied to three financial use cases. Our experiments on two existing packages reveal that zkFinGPT introduces substantial computational overhead that hinders its real-world adoption.

Genetic Programming (GP) has been widely applied to automatically evolve scheduling rules for DFJSS. However, existing studies typically train and test GP-evolved rules on DFJSS instances of the same type, which differ only by random seeds rather than by structural characteristics, leaving their cross-type generalisation ability largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalisation ability of GP-evolved scheduling rules under diverse DFJSS conditions. A series of experiments are conducted across multiple dimensions, including problem scale (i.e., the number of machines and jobs), key job shop parameters (e.g., utilisation level), and data distributions, to analyse how these factors influence GP performance on unseen instance types. The results show that good generalisation occurs when the training instances contain more jobs than the test instances while keeping the number of machines fixed, and when both training and test instances have similar scales or job shop parameters. Further analysis reveals that the number and distribution of decision points in DFJSS instances play a crucial role in explaining these performance differences. Similar decision point distributions lead to better generalisation, whereas significant discrepancies result in a marked degradation of performance. Overall, this study provides new insights into the generalisation ability of GP in DFJSS and highlights the necessity of evolving more generalisable GP rules capable of handling heterogeneous DFJSS instances effectively."}

However, in real-world scenarios, individual frames encode not only speaker-relevant information but also various nuisance factors. As a result, different frames contribute unequally to the final utterance-level speaker representation for Automatic Speaker Verification systems. To address this issue, we propose to estimate the inherent uncertainty of each frame and assign adaptive weights accordingly, where frames with higher uncertainty receive lower attention. Based on this idea, we present U3-xi, a comprehensive framework designed to produce more reliable and interpretable uncertainty estimates for speaker embeddings. Specifically, we introduce several strategies for uncertainty supervision. First, we propose speaker-level uncertainty supervision via a Stochastic Variance Loss, where the distance between an utterance embedding and its corresponding speaker centroid serves as a pseudo ground truth for uncertainty learning. Second, we incorporate global-level uncertainty supervision by injecting the predicted uncertainty into the sof tmax scale during training. This adaptive scaling mechanism adjusts the sharpness of the decision boundary according to sample difficulty, providing global guidance. Third, we redesign the uncertainty estimation module by integrating a Transformer encoder with multi-view self-attention, enabling the model to capture rich local and long-range temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that U3-xi is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly applied to various speaker encoders. In particular, when applied to ECAPA-TDNN, it achieves 21.1% and 15.57% relative improvements on the VoxCeleb1 test sets in terms of EER and minDCF, respectively."}

Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals."}

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs."}

Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions.

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding."}

The key problem that arises in this context is to choose a limited number of highly influential users as the initial adopters of a brand such that the influence regarding the brand in the network gets maximized. Deviating from this standard setting, in this paper, we study the problem where every user of the network is associated with a selection cost and a benefit value. This benefit value can be earned from the user if (s)he is influenced by the brand. A fixed amount of budget is allocated for selecting the seed users. The goal of initial adopters is to choose a set of seed users within the budget such that the profit is maximized. We propose a two phase diffusion model for this problem where the goal is to split the diffusion process into two phases, and hence, split the budget into two halves. First, we spend the first half budget to select seed users for the first phase and observe the diffusion for a few rounds and then deploy the seed users for the second phase and successively complete the diffusion process. We prove several properties of the two phase influence function. Three solution approaches have been proposed for our problem with detailed analysis and illustrative examples. We conduct a number of experiments with three real-world social network datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the two phase diffusion approach leads to more amount of profit compared to the single-phase diffusion. In particular, for most instances, this improvement is greater than 18% and reaching as high as 40% by the proposed methodologies."}

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop.

To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy.

To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline.

The flexible assembly flow shop scheduling problem formally defines dependencies for multi-stage kitting, yet dynamic variants make designing integrated scheduling rules under multi-level time coupling highly challenging. Existing automated heuristic design methods, particularly genetic programming constrained to fixed terminal symbol sets, struggle to capture and leverage dynamic uncertainties and hierarchical dependency information under transient decision states. This study develops an LLM-assisted Dynamic Rule Design framework (LLM4DRD) that automatically evolves integrated online scheduling rules adapted to scheduling features. Firstly, multi-stage processing and assembly supply decisions are transformed into feasible directed edge orderings based on heterogeneous graph. Then, an elite knowledge guided initialization embeds advanced design expertise into initial rules to enhance initial quality. Additionally, a dual-expert mechanism is introduced in which LLM-A evolutionary code to generate candidate rules and LLM-S conducts scheduling evaluation, while dynamic feature-fitting rule evolution combined with hybrid evaluation enables continuous improvement and extracts adaptive rules with strong generalization capability. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the method. The average tardiness of LLM4DRD is 3.17-12.39% higher than state-of-the-art methods in 20 practical instances used for training and testing, respectively.

This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity."}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes.

To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation.

Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities."}

By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed.

Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools."}

However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement."}

Different from conventional open-loop generative models, our approach establishes a closed-loop refinement framework via a serial restart mechanism and anchored trajectory rectification. By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy.

We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results."}

To address the need, we design and build FirmReBugger, a holistic framework for fairly assessing monolithic firmware fuzzers with a realistic, diverse, bug-based benchmark. FirmReBugger proposes using bug oracles--C syntax expressions of bug descriptors--with an interpreter to automate analysis and accurately report on bugs discovered, discriminating between states of detected, triggered, reached and not reached. Importantly, our idea of benchmarking does not modify the target binary and simply replays fuzzing seeds to isolate the benchmark implementation from the fuzzer while providing a simple means to extend with new bug oracles. Further, analyzing fuzzing roadblocks, we created FirmBench, a set of diverse, real-world binary targets with 313 software bug oracles. Incorporating our analysis of roadblocks challenging monolithic firmware fuzzing, the bench provides for rapid evaluation of future advances. We implement FirmReBugger in a FuzzBench-for-Firmware type service and use FirmBench to evaluate 9 state-of-the art monolithic firmware fuzzers in the style of a reproducibility study, using a 10 CPU-year effort, to report our findings."}

Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents."}

Accurate prediction is highly reliant on extensive training data, including precise molecular geometries and the Hamiltonian matrices, which are expensive to acquire via either experimental or computational methods. Towards a fast yet accurate method for Hamiltonian prediction, we first introduce a geometry information-aware molecular language model to bypass the use of expensive molecular geometries by only using the readily available molecular language -- simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES). Our method employs multimodal alignment to bridge the relationship between SMILES strings and their corresponding molecular geometries. Recognizing that the molecular language inherently lacks explicit geometric information, we propose a geometry modality compensation strategy to imbue molecular language representations with essential geometric features, thereby enabling accurate predictions using SMILES. In addition, given the high cost of acquiring Hamiltonian data, we devise a weakly supervised strategy to fine-tune the molecular language model, thus improving the data efficiency. Theoretically, we prove that the prediction generalization error without explicit molecular geometry can be bounded through our modality compensation scheme. Empirically, our method achieves superior computational efficiency, providing up to 100x speedup over conventional quantum mechanical methods while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy. We further demonstrate the practical case study of our approach in the screening of electrolyte formulations."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization."}

We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains."}

This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability."}

GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore.

Yet realizing this potential symbiotically -- where biological and digital agents co-adapt and co-process -- remains elusive, largely due to the absence of a shared vocabulary bridging biology and computing. Consequently, microbes are often constrained to uni-directional roles, functioning as sensors or actuators rather than as active, computational partners in bio-digital systems. In response, we propose a taxonomy and pathways that articulate and expand the roles of biological and digital entities for synergetic bio-digital computation. Using this taxonomy, we analysed 70 systems across HCI, design, and engineering, identifying how biological mechanisms can be mapped onto computational abstractions. We argue that such mappings enable computationally actionable directions that foster richer and reciprocal relationships in bio-digital systems, supporting regenerative ecologies across time and scale while inspiring new paradigms for computation in HCI."}

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities."}

Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages."}

In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score.

A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge."}

Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies.

Its reverse-complement variant, the Shortest Common Superstring problem with Reverse Complements (SCS-RC), naturally arises in bioinformatics applications, where for each input string, either the string itself or its reverse complement must appear as a substring of the superstring. The well-known MGREEDY algorithm for the standard SCS constructs a superstring by first computing an optimal cycle cover on the overlap graph and then concatenating the strings corresponding to the cycles, while its refined variant, TGREEDY, further improves the approximation ratio. Although the original 4- and 3-approximation bounds of these algorithms have been successively improved for the standard SCS, no such progress has been made for the reverse-complement setting. A previous study extended MGREEDY to SCS-RC with a 4-approximation guarantee and briefly suggested that extending TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting could achieve a 3-approximation. In this work, we strengthen these results by proving that the extensions of MGREEDY and TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting achieve 3.75- and 2.875-approximation ratios, respectively. Our analysis extends the classical proofs for the standard SCS to handle the bidirectional overlaps introduced by reverse complements. These results provide the first formal improvement of approximation guarantees for SCS-RC, with the 2.875-approximate algorithm currently representing the best known bound for this problem."}

For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance.

To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training.

However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here."}

In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

Petit"], "title": "Practical applications of Set Shaping Theory to Non-Uniform Sequences", "categories": ["cs.IT"], "comment": null, "summary": "Set Shaping Theory (SST) moves beyond the classical fixed-space model by constructing bijective mappings the original sequence set into structured regions of a larger sequence space. These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) < NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences. Finally, to ensure full reproducibility, the software implementing the proposed method has been made publicly available on GitHub, enabling independent verification of the results reported in this work"}

Most parliaments are assembled using apportionment methods that distribute the seats based on the parties' vote counts. Common apportionment methods include divisor sequence methods (like D'Hondt or Sainte-Laguë), the largest-remainder method, and first-past-the-post. In many countries, an electoral threshold is implemented to prevent very small parties from entering the parliament. Further, several countries have apportionment systems that incorporate multiple districts. We study how computationally hard it is to change the election outcome (i.e., to increase or limit the influence of a distinguished party) by convincing a limited number of voters to change their vote. We refer to these bribery-style attacks as \\emph{strategic campaigns} and study the corresponding problems in terms of their computational (both classical and parameterized) complexity. We also run extensive experiments on real-world election data and study the effectiveness of optimal campaigns, in particular as opposed to using heuristic bribing strategies and with respect to the influence of the threshold and the influence of the number of districts. For apportionment elections with threshold, finally, we propose -- as an alternative to the standard top-choice mode -- the second-chance mode where voters of parties below the threshold receive a second chance to vote for another party, and we establish computational complexity results also in this setting."}

However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation.

In undirected social graphs, the potential for envy is in both the directions. In the Minimum Envy Graphical House Allocation (ME-GHA) problem, given a set of $n$ agents, $n$ houses, a social graph, and agent's valuation functions, the goal is to find an allocation that minimizes the total envy summed up over all the edges of $G$.

We initiate the study of \\gha with non-identical valuations, a setting that has so far remained unexplored. We investigate the multivariate (parameterized) complexity of \\gha by identifying structural restrictions on the social graph and valuation functions that yield tractability.

As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures.

However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%).

To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks.

However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to multi-spectral scenarios remains challenging. Current approaches often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information of multi-modal data, typically relying on mechanisms that either tend to neglect cross-modal correlations or leverage shared representations that fail to adaptively handle the complex structural correlations and physical discrepancies between spectrums. To address these limitations, we propose ThermoSplat, a novel framework that enables deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling. First, we introduce a Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation mechanism that dynamically conditions shared latent features on thermal structural priors, effectively guiding visible texture synthesis with reliable cross-modal geometric cues. Second, to accommodate modality-specific geometric inconsistencies, we propose a Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling scheme that learns independent opacity offsets and executes an independent rasterization pass for the thermal branch. Additionally, a hybrid rendering pipeline is employed to integrate explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding, ensuring both semantic consistency and high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on the RGBT-Scenes dataset demonstrate that ThermoSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both visible and thermal spectrums."}

Further, rigorous analytical guarantees on the performance of these existing techniques are largely absent. This work presents a new method for code-identification on the binary symmetric channel (BSC), inspired by the framework of subspace codes for operator channels, carefully combining principles of hamming-metric and subspace-metric decoding. We refer to this method as the minimum denoised subspace discrepancy decoder. We present theoretical guarantees for code-identification using this decoder, for bounded-weight errors, and also present a bound on the probability of error when used on the BSC. Simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our decoder for random linear codes beyond existing general-purpose techniques, across most channel conditions and even with a limited number of received vectors."}

Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \\texttt{gate\\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling."}

These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding.

To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments."}

To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance."}

Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage.

To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency.

However, these platforms also foster problematic usage patterns, commonly referred to as short-video addiction, which pose risks to both user health and the sustainable development of platforms. Prior studies on this issue have primarily relied on questionnaires or volunteer-based data collection, which are often limited by small sample sizes and population biases. In contrast, short-video platforms have large-scale behavioral data, offering a valuable foundation for analyzing addictive behaviors. To examine addiction-aware behavior patterns, we combine economic addiction theory with users' implicit behavior captured by recommendation systems. Our analysis shows that short-video addiction follows functional patterns similar to traditional forms of addictive behavior (e.g., substance abuse) and that its intensity is consistent with findings from previous social science studies. To develop a simulator that can learn and model these patterns, we introduce a novel training framework, AddictSim. To consider the personalized addiction patterns, AddictSim uses a mean-to-adapted strategy with group relative policy optimization training. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that AddictSim consistently outperforms existing training strategies. Our simulation results show that integrating diversity-aware algorithms can mitigate addictive behaviors well."}

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services."}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

To overcome these challenges, we present PUMA, an end-to-end learning framework that integrates visual perception and foothold priors into a single-stage training process. This approach leverages terrain features to estimate egocentric polar foothold priors, composed of relative distance and heading, guiding the robot in active posture adaptation for parkour tasks.

To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models.

However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization."}

While visual representations, such as UML diagrams, are widely used alongside text-based requirements, their effectiveness in supporting inspection is still debated. Cognitive abilities, such as working memory and mental rotation skills, may also influence inspection accuracy. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of UML sequence diagrams alongside text-based requirements improves the accuracy of requirements inspection compared to text-based requirements alone and to explore whether cognitive abilities are associated with differences in performance across the two treatments (text vs text with UML support). We conducted a crossover experiment with 38 participants to assess the accuracy of requirements inspection under the two treatments in terms of issues found and justifications provided. Linear mixed-effects and generalized linear models were used to analyse the effects of treatment, period, sequence, and cognitive abilities. The results indicate a significant three-way interaction between representation type, working memory capacity, and mental rotation ability. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of UML support is not uniform across individuals: participants with high scores in both cognitive abilities experienced reduced performance when using UML for violation detection. Conversely, the same cognitive profile was associated with improved justification accuracy under UML-aided inspection, indicating that higher cognitive abilities may support deeper reasoning processes when dealing with multi-modal information, i.e., diagrams and text."}

We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum.

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods."}

Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling."}

While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery."}

In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment.

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information."}

Moreover, in order to avoid error propagation and data association in traditional sensing methods, we model low-altitude surveillance as an imaging problem based on compressed sensing theory, which can be solved through the subspace pursuit algorithm. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed RIS-aided low-altitude imaging system and analyze the impacts of various system parameters on sensing performance, providing guidance for ISAC system configuration.

By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage.

To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click.

Workshop page: https://moleculediscovery.github.io/workshop2025/", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning.

A tree-ordered $σ$-structure is the expansion of a $σ$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $σ$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $σ$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs.\n  We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $σ$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $AW[*]\\neq FPT$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory."}

Yet, testing interventions to encourage prosocial dispositions, such as open-mindedness, has been hindered by researchers' limited ability to manipulate platform features and isolate causal effects in commercial environments. We address this challenge through a randomized controlled trial with 2,282 U.S. adults conducted on a new research platform we developed that uses AI bots to replicate live social media dynamics while enabling controlled experimentation. Participants engaged in 15-minute discussions about energy and climate topics, with treatment groups exposed to curiosity priming either through modified on-platform social norms, interface affordances, or both. Results demonstrate that curiosity priming significantly increased question-asking behavior and textual measures of curiosity in user posts, while also reducing toxicity. Although interventions decreased generic engagement behaviors like liking and commenting, they had no significant negative impact on reported app enjoyment or time spent writing posts and replies. Leveraging experimental control over platform features, our findings suggest that platform designs prioritizing curiosity can promote prosocial behaviors among users without compromising user experience."}

Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency.

Victims experience various types of harm after cybercrimes, including monetary loss, data breaches, negative emotions, and even psychological trauma. The aspects that support their recovery process and contribute to individual cyber resilience remain underinvestigated. To address this gap, we interviewed 18 cybercrime victims from Western Europe using a trauma-informed approach. We identified four common stages following victimization: recognition, coping, processing, and recovery. Participants adopted various strategies to mitigate the impact of cybercrime and used different indicators to describe recovery. While they mostly relied on social support and self-regulation for emotional coping, service providers largely determined whether victims were able to recover their money. Internal factors, external support, and context sensitivity collectively contribute to individuals' cyber resilience. We recommend trauma-informed support for cybercrime victims. Extending our conceptualization of individual cyber resilience, we propose collaborative and context-sensitive strategies to address the harmful impacts of cybercrime."}

Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules."}

It has been accepted by IEEE ISBI", "summary": "Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images."}

This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs.

To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines.

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference.

This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness."}

In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant."}

By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens.

This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages. This approach enables incremental language expansion to new languages by requiring only one LoRA adapter and a lightweight MLP retraining. Learned adapter fusion offers a practical alternative to expensive joint fine-tuning, balancing performance, data efficiency, and scalability for multilingual Text2Cypher task."}

This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner. Experiments on the Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Liao-Ning 01 datasets demonstrate that CSSMamba achieves higher accuracy and better boundary preservation compared to state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods."}

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable.

To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss. This supervision enables the policy to efficiently learn corrective behaviors that compensate for unmodeled effects without extensive reward shaping.

By adjusting logistic regression coefficients, our model can represent split positions at arbitrary locations within each interval. This enables more compact tree representations. For simultaneous estimation of both split positions and tree depth, we develop an effective inference algorithm that combines local variational approximation for logistic regression with the context tree weighting (CTW) algorithm.

SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale."}

Even though the geometric structures for this are obvious and some works already use an exponential algorithm, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no canonical structure of the LLG equation for the exponential update algorithm in micromagnetism. Tensor algebraic reformulations of the LLG equation allow the canonical representation of the evolution equation for the magnetization, which serves as the basis for different integrators. Based on the specific structure of the exponential of skew symmetric matrices an efficient update scheme is derived. The excellent performance of the proposed exponential update algorithm is demonstrated in representative examples."}

To overcome this issue, we combine the non-uniform filter method with a stable extrapolation method to recover the function values near the jump discontinuities.

Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories.

Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model.

In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $Ω$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $Ω$. Given a probability measure $μ$ on $Ω$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $φ\\to \\int_ΩK(\\cdot,x)φ(x)dμ(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $Ω$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $μ$ supported on $Ω$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + ε})$ for any $ε> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $μ$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $ε$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(ε^{-d_ρ}\\log\\frac{1}ε\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments.

The improved scheme relaxes previous constraints on parameter sequences, allowing learning rates to converge to zero or not converge at all. While seemingly minor, this flexibility is essential to enable the implementation of chaotic iterations, where only a subset of components is updated in each step, allowing to tackle higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, by allowing learning rates to converge to zero, we can relax conditions on the convergence speed of function approximations, making the method more adaptable to various scenarios.

However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies.

Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality."}

Recent single encoder transformer approaches have framed harmonization as a masked sequence modeling problem, but existing training curricula inspired by discrete diffusion often result in weak (cross) attention between melody and harmony. This leads to limited exploitation of melodic cues, particularly in out-of-domain contexts. In this work, we introduce a training curriculum, FF (full-to-full), which keeps all harmony tokens masked for several training steps before progressively unmasking entire sequences during training to strengthen melody-harmony interactions. We systematically evaluate this approach against prior curricula across multiple experimental axes, including temporal quantization (quarter vs. sixteenth note), bar-level vs. time-signature conditioning, melody representation (full range vs. pitch class), and inference-time unmasking strategies. Models are trained on the HookTheory dataset and evaluated both in-domain and on a curated collection of jazz standards, using a comprehensive set of metrics that assess chord progression structure, harmony-melody alignment, and rhythmic coherence. Results demonstrate that the proposed FF curriculum consistently outperforms baselines in nearly all metrics, with particularly strong gains in out-of-domain evaluations where harmonic adaptability to novel melodic queues is crucial. We further find that quarter-note quantization, intertwining of bar tokens, and pitch-class melody representations are advantageous in the FF setting. Our findings highlight the importance of training curricula in enabling effective melody conditioning and suggest that full-to-full unmasking offers a robust strategy for single encoder harmonization."}

Case"], "title": "Substrate Stability Under Persistent Disagreement: Structural Constraints for Neutral Ontological Substrates", "categories": ["cs.LO", "cs.AI"], "comment": "29 pages", "summary": "Modern data systems increasingly operate under conditions of persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. In such settings, interoperability cannot rely on shared interpretation, negotiated semantics, or centralized authority. Instead, representations must function as neutral substrates that preserve stable reference across incompatible extensions. This paper investigates the structural constraints imposed on ontological design by this requirement. Building on a neutrality framework that treats interpretive non-commitment and stability under extension as explicit design constraints, we ask what minimal ontological structure is forced if accountability relationships are to remain referable and comparable under disagreement. Minimality here is not mere parsimony: a reduction is admissible only if it does not reintroduce stability-critical distinctions as hidden roles, flags, or contextual predicates. We establish a conditional lower-bound result: any ontology capable of supporting accountability under persistent disagreement must realize at least six distinct identity-and-persistence regimes. We further show that a construction with exactly six such regimes is sufficient to satisfy the stated requirements without embedding causal or normative commitments in the substrate. The result is not a proposal for a universal ontology, but a constraint on what is possible when neutrality and stable reference are treated as non-negotiable design goals."}

Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy.

Strict local search starts with some assignment and follows some update rule to proceed to an adjacent assignment of strictly higher fitness. This means that strict local search algorithms follow ascents in the fitness landscape of the pseudo-Boolean function. The complexity of the pseudo-Boolean function (and the fitness landscapes that it represents) can be parameterized by properties of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) that encodes the pseudo-Boolean function. We focus on properties of the constraint graphs of the VCSP, with the intuition that spare graphs are less complex than dense ones. Specifically, we argue that pathwidth is the natural sparsity parameter for understanding limits on the power of strict local search. We show that prior constructions of sparse VCSPs where all ascents are exponentially long had pathwidth greater than or equal to four. We improve this this with our controlled doubling construction: a valued constraint satisfaction problem of pathwidth three where all ascents are exponentially long from a designated initial assignment. From this, we conclude that all strict local search algorithms can be forced to take an exponential number of steps even on simple valued constraint graphs of pathwidth three."}

However, these approaches remain confined to the spatial domain with limited feature representation. Therefore, this paper presents CONTEX-T, a novel framework that exploits contextual privacy vulnerabilities using spectral representation of encrypted wireless traffic for IoT device characterization. The experiments show that spectral analysis provides new and rich feature representation for covert reconnaissance attacks, revealing a complex and expanding threat landscape that would require robust countermeasures for IoT security management. CONTEXT-T first transforms raw packet length sequences into time-frequency spectral representations and then utilizes transformer-based spectral analysis for the device identification.

Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations.

Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a hybrid quantum-HPC method in which information from a molecular Hamiltonian is encoded into a quantum circuit for evaluation on a quantum computer. A set of measurements on the quantum computer yields electronic configurations that are filtered on the classical computer, which also performs diagonalization on the selected subspace and identifies configurations to be carried over to the next step in an iterative process. Diagonalization is the most demanding task for the classical computer. Previous studies used the Fugaku supercomputer and a highly scalable diagonalization code designed for CPUs.

Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder.

Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness."}

In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models."}

We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding."}

However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Standard theory predicts otherwise: either the weaker firm exits, or survivors raise prices to monopoly levels. We argue the puzzle dissolves once firms are viewed as ecosystem optimizers rather than single-market profit maximizers. We develop a dynamic game in which a firm's willingness to subsidize depends on the spillover value its users generate in adjacent markets -- what we call \\textit{ecosystem complementarity}. When this complementarity is strong enough, perpetual below-cost pricing emerges as the unique stable equilibrium. The result is not predation in the classical sense; there is no recoupment phase. It is a permanent state of subsidized competition, rational for each firm individually but potentially inefficient in aggregate. We characterize the equilibrium, establish its dynamic stability, and show that welfare losses compound over time as capital flows into subsidy wars rather than innovation. The model's predictions are consistent with observed patterns in Chinese platform markets and suggest that effective antitrust intervention should target cross-market capital flows rather than prices."}

Neuroscience explains this through Complementary Learning Systems theory - a fast hippocampal system for episodic storage using pattern-separated representations, and a slow neocortical system for extracting statistical regularities. Current AI systems lack this separation, attempting both functions through neural weights alone. We identify the 'Stability Gap' in online neural memory: fast-weight mechanisms that write facts into shared continuous parameters collapse to near-random accuracy within tens of semantically related facts. Through semantic density (rho), we show collapse occurs with as few as N=5 facts at high density (rho > 0.6) or N ~ 20-75 at moderate density - a phenomenon we formalise as the Orthogonality Constraint. This failure persists even with perfect attention and unlimited context, arising from write-time interference when storage and retrieval share the same substrate. We also identify schema drift and version ambiguity as primary failure modes in production systems, observing 40-70% schema consistency and 0-100% clean correction rates. Context-based memory incurs 30-300% cost premium over selective retrieval. We propose Knowledge Objects (KOs): discrete, typed memory units with controlled vocabularies and explicit version chains. Paired with neural weights, KOs enable a true complementary learning architecture, suggesting reliable AI memory may require this bicameral design."}

This article argues that complementarity is most productively interpreted as an epistemic principle--constraining what can be simultaneously accessed and represented--rather than as an ontological claim about quantum reality. Reexamining the Einstein-Bohr debate through this lens reveals a persistent tension between descriptive completeness and contextual meaning, a tension experiments clarify but do not dissolve. Building on this analysis, we introduce cognitive complementarity as a structural principle governing reasoning under non-classical uncertainty, where mutually constraining representations cannot be jointly optimized. Within this framework, we propose quantum intuition as a testable cognitive capacity: the ability to sustain representational plurality, regulate commitment timing, and resolve perspective-incompatibilities in a context-sensitive manner. Formulated as a naturalistic construct grounded in shared informational constraints, quantum intuition offers a principled bridge between quantum measurement theory and cognition.

This paper develops a static axiomatic framework in which relation maintenance is treated as a problem of structural compatibility rather than strategic choice or stochastic realization. Agents occupy positions in an abstract space and relations are subject to minimum conditions defined over these positions. A bifurcation event such as a vote declaration or institutional assignment fixes agents positions and thereby determines which relations are compatible. We identify position dependent gain axes as the key source of structural selectivity and prove an impossibility result under any non degenerate positional constraint no bifurcation event can preserve all relations. Instead the post event network necessarily exhibits either the simultaneous emergence of fragmentation and cohesion or a degenerate trivial case in which constraints are position independent. The result is purely structural and does not rely on preferences beliefs incentives or dynamic adjustment. It establishes a fundamental limit on universally cohesive outcomes and reframes division not as a failure of design or coordination but as a logical consequence of positional constraints."}

This study examines whether LLMs can generate psychometric responses that approximate those of real individuals when grounded in a structured qualitative interview, and whether such simulations are sensitive to variations in trait intensity. Twenty-six adults completed a 29-item open-ended interview and four standardized self-report measures (ASRS, BAARS-IV, AQ, RAADS-R). Two LLMs (GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B) were prompted to infer an individual psychological profile from interview content and then respond to each questionnaire in-role. Accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity were assessed using group-level comparisons, error metrics, exact-match scoring, and a randomized baseline. Both models outperformed random responses across instruments, with GPT-4o showing higher accuracy and reproducibility. Simulated responses closely matched human data for ASRS, BAARS-IV, and RAADS-R, while the AQ revealed subscale-specific limitations, particularly in Attention to Detail. Overall, the findings indicate that interview-grounded LLMs can produce coherent and above-chance simulations of neurodevelopmental traits, supporting their potential use as synthetic participants in early-stage psychometric research, while highlighting clear domain-specific constraints."}

We introduce ECGomics, a systematic paradigm and open-source platform for the multidimensional deconstruction of cardiac signals into digital biomarker. Methods: Inspired by the taxonomic rigor of genomics, ECGomics deconstructs cardiac activity across four dimensions: Structural, Intensity, Functional, and Comparative. This taxonomy synergizes expert-defined morphological rules with data-driven latent representations, effectively bridging the gap between handcrafted features and deep learning embeddings. Results: We operationalized this framework into a scalable ecosystem consisting of a web-based research platform and a mobile-integrated solution (https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGomics). The web platform facilitates high-throughput analysis via precision parameter configuration, high-fidelity data ingestion, and 12-lead visualization, allowing for the systematic extraction of biomarkers across the four ECGomics dimensions. Complementarily, the mobile interface, integrated with portable sensors and a cloud-based engine, enables real-time signal acquisition and near-instantaneous delivery of structured diagnostic reports. This dual-interface architecture successfully transitions ECGomics from theoretical discovery to decentralized, real-world health management, ensuring professional-grade monitoring in diverse clinical and home-based settings.

In canonical spatial domains, transitions along the attractor manifold are driven by continuous displacement signals, such as angular velocity-provided by sensorimotor systems external to the CAN itself. When such signals are not explicitly provided as dedicated displacement inputs, it remains unclear whether attractor-based circuits can reliably acquire recurrent dynamics that support stable state transitions, or whether alternative predictive strategies dominate.\n  In this work, we present an experimental framework for training CANs to perform successor-like transitions between stable attractor states in the absence of externally provided displacement signals. We compare two recurrent topologies, a circular ring and a folded snake manifold, and systematically vary the temporal regime under which stability is evaluated. We find that, under short evaluation windows, networks consistently converge to impulse-driven associative solutions that achieve high apparent accuracy yet lack persistent attractor dynamics. Only when stability is explicitly enforced over extended free-run periods do genuine attractor-based transition dynamics emerge. This suggests that shortcut solutions are the default outcome of local learning in recurrent networks, while attractor dynamics represent a constrained regime rather than a generic result.\n  Furthermore, we demonstrate that topology strictly limits the capacity for learned transitions. While the continuous ring topology achieves perfect stability over long horizons, the folded snake topology hits a geometric limit characterized by failure at manifold discontinuities, which neither curriculum learning nor basal ganglia-inspired gating can fully overcome."}

OmniSpectra is the first foundation model to learn simultaneously from multiple real-world spectra surveys with different configurations at a large scale. We achieve this by designing a novel architecture with adaptive patching across variable lengths, sinusoidal global wavelength encoding, local positional embeddings through depthwise convolution, and validity-aware self-attention masks.

When quantum information is encoded redundantly, a larger Hilbert space is constructed using multiple physical qubits, and the computation is performed within a designated subspace. When applying deep learning to the decoding of quantum error-correcting codes, a key challenge arises from the non-uniqueness between the syndrome measurements provided to the decoder and the corresponding error patterns that constitute the ground-truth labels. Building upon prior work that addressed this issue for the toric code by re-optimizing the decoder with respect to the symmetry inherent in the parity-check structure, we generalize this approach to arbitrary stabilizer codes. In our experiments, we employed multilayer perceptrons to approximate continuous functions that complement the syndrome measurements of the Color code and the Golay code. Using these models, we performed decoder re-optimization for each code. For the Color code, we achieved an improvement of approximately 0.8% in decoding accuracy at a physical error rate of 5%, while for the Golay code the accuracy increased by about 0.1%. Furthermore, from the evaluation of the geometric and algebraic structures in the continuous function approximation for each code, we showed that the design of generalized continuous functions is advantageous for learning the geometric structure inherent in the code. Our results also indicate that approximations that faithfully reproduce the code structure can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of reoptimization. This study demonstrates that the re-optimization technique previously shown to be effective for the Toric code can be generalized to address the challenge of label degeneracy that arises when applying deep learning to the decoding of stabilizer codes."}

We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal.

The principal then takes an action whose payoff consequences for both players are publicly known. Under the assumption that the possible technology sets are ordered by set inclusion, we show that the optimal mechanism promises the agent a utility that is weakly increasing as the reported set expands, and the choice of the principal maximizes her own utility subject to this promised utility constraint. Moreover, the optimal promised utility either coincides with the agent's utility under the complete information benchmark or remains locally constant, with the number of constant segments bounded by the number of downward-sloping segments of the complete information benchmark."}

This paper introduces a failure detection algorithm based on quantum computing and a statistical change-point detection approach. Our method leverages the potential of projected quantum feature maps to enhance the precision of anomaly detection in machine monitoring systems. We empirically validate our approach on benchmark multi-dimensional time series datasets as well as on a real-world dataset comprising IoT sensor readings from operational machines, ensuring the practical relevance of our study. The algorithm was executed on IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum processor, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating quantum computing into industrial maintenance procedures. The presented results underscore the effectiveness of our quantum-based failure detection system, showcasing its capability to accurately identify anomalies in noisy time series data. This work not only highlights the potential of quantum computing in industrial diagnostics but also paves the way for more sophisticated quantum algorithms in the realm of predictive maintenance."}

Proofs of formulas with positive logical polarity correspond to CPTP (completely positive trace-preserving) maps in our model, i.e. the quantum operations in the Schrödinger picture, whereas proofs of formulas with negative logical polarity correspond to CPU (completely positive unital) maps, i.e. the quantum operations in the Heisenberg picture. The mathematical development is based on noncommutative geometry and finite-dimensional von Neumann (co)algebras, which can be defined as special kinds of (co)monoid objects internal to the category of finite-dimensional operator spaces."}

The method applies stochastic gradient ascent to a surrogate objective obtained by first performing a power transformation and then Gaussian smoothing, $F_{N,σ}(\\bmμ):=\\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{w}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bmμ,σ^2I_d),\\bm{x}\\sim\\mathcal{D}}[e^{Nf_w(\\bm{x})}]$, while progressively increasing the power parameter $N$ and decreasing the smoothing scale $σ$ along the optimization trajectory. We prove that, under mild regularity conditions, Prog-PowerHP converges to a small neighborhood of the global optimum with an iteration complexity scaling nearly as $O(d^2\\varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirically, Prog-PowerHP demonstrates clear advantages in phase retrieval when the samples-to-dimension ratio approaches the information-theoretic limit, and in training two-layer neural networks in under-parameterized regimes. These results suggest that Prog-PowerHP is particularly effective for navigating cluttered non-convex landscapes where standard first-order methods struggle."}

The algorithm uses various pruning techniques to avoid having to first generate all labeled realizations of the input sequence and then testing whether each labeled realization is triangle-free. It can be further extended to generate all labeled bipartite graphs with a given graphical degree sequence by adding a simple test whether each generated triangle-free realization is a bipartite graph. All output graphs are generated in the lexicographical ordering as in the original algorithm. The algorithms can also be easily parallelized."}

Includes reproducibility code and archived data release", "summary": "We implement and benchmark on IBM Quantum hardware the circuit family proposed by Violaris for estimating operational inter-branch communication witnesses, defined as correlations in classical measurement records produced by compiled Wigner's-friend-style circuits. We realize a five-qubit instance of the protocol as an inter-register message-transfer pattern within a single circuit, rather than physical signaling, and evaluate its behavior under realistic device noise and compilation constraints. The circuit encodes branch-conditioned evolution of an observer subsystem whose dynamics depend on a control qubit, followed by a controlled transfer operation that probes correlations between conditional measurement contexts.\n  Executing on the ibm_fez backend with 20000 shots, we observe population-based visibility of 0.877, coherence witnesses of 0.840 and -0.811 along orthogonal axes, and a phase-sensitive magnitude of approximately 1.17. While the visibility metric is insensitive to some classes of dephasing, the coherence witnesses provide complementary sensitivity to off-diagonal noise.\n  This work does not test or discriminate among interpretations of quantum mechanics. Instead, it provides a reproducible operational constraint pipeline for evaluating detectability of non-ideal channels relative to calibrated device noise."}

The problem incorporates three key compartment-related features: (i) compartment flexibility in the number of compartments, (ii) item-to-compartment compatibility, and (iii) item-to-item compatibility. The problem also accommodates practical operational requirements such as driver breaks. To solve the MCVRPMTW, we develop an exact branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm in which the pricing problem is solved using a labeling algorithm. Several acceleration strategies are introduced to limit symmetry during label extensions, improve the stability of dual solutions in column generation, and enhance the branching process. To handle large-scale instances, we propose a rolling-space B&P algorithm that integrates clustering techniques into the solution framework. Extensive computational experiments on instances inspired by a real-world industrial application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide useful managerial insights for practical implementation."}
