An example in Alzheimer's disease area", "categories": ["stat.AP", "q-bio.NC", "stat.ME"], "comment": null, "summary": "Background: Clinical trials are designed to prove the efficacy of an\nintervention by means of model-based approaches involving parametric hypothesis\ntesting. Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population.\nIndeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot\ndetect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm\nto a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another\nperspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of\nsubjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention\ntrials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of\nprevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which\nrequires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account.\nThe primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different\nmethods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain\nAlzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial\nwith four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite\nZ-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic\nmixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is\ntherefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory\nclassification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal\ndata, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised\nanalysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status.\nResults: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and\none of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up.\nThis method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite\nZ-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised\nmethods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore\nnecessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the\nrate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation\nwas performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the\ngraphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define\nresponder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria.\nDiscussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be\ninconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have\nmasked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta\nAmyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to\nsubject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify\npatterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the\npotential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the\nfinal endpoint considered."}

Nevertheless, the\nblack-box nature of tree ensembles is a strong limitation, especially for\napplications with critical decisions at stake. The Hoeffding or ANOVA\nfunctional decomposition is a powerful explainability method, as it breaks down\nblack-box models into a unique sum of lower-dimensional functions, provided\nthat input variables are independent. In standard learning settings, input\nvariables are often dependent, and the Hoeffding decomposition is generalized\nthrough hierarchical orthogonality constraints.

Due to the continuous control\nnature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the\nproblem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm\nwith prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies.\nBased on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling\nand bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly\noutperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance,\nachieving approximately 14.4\\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison\nto the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive\ntrajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS\ntilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment."}

Recent work has proposed\nalternative causal estimands to the standard VE to address this issue, but\ntheir point identification results require a strong assumption: the absence of\nunmeasured common causes of infection risk and participants' belief about\nwhether they received the vaccine. Personality traits, for example, may\nplausibly violate this assumption. We relax this assumption and derive\nnonparametric causal bounds for different types of VE. We construct these\nbounds using two approaches: linear programming-based and monotonicity-based\nmethods.

These forecasts typically exhibit\nbias and inaccurate dependence structures due to numerical and dispersion\nerrors, requiring statistical postprocessing for improved precision.

The second step is\nusually handled with nonparametric methods, which can underperform when\nhistorical data are limited. Parametric alternatives, such as the Gaussian\nCopula Approach (GCA), offer theoretical advantages but often produce poorly\ncalibrated multivariate forecasts due to random sampling of the corrected\nunivariate margins. In this work, we introduce COBASE, a novel copula-based\npostprocessing framework that preserves the flexibility of parametric modeling\nwhile mimicking the nonparametric techniques through a rank-shuffling\nmechanism.

We evaluate COBASE on multi-site 2-meter temperature forecasts\nfrom the ALADIN-LAEF ensemble over Austria and on joint forecasts of\ntemperature and dew point temperature from the ECMWF system in the Netherlands.\nAcross all regions, COBASE variants consistently outperform traditional\ncopula-based approaches, such as GCA, and achieve performance on par with\nstate-of-the-art nonparametric methods like SimSchaake and ECC, with only\nminimal differences across settings.

Inspired by the geometric structure, we\nprovide an unconditional, deterministic and polynomial time algorithm, albeit\nwith fairly high complexity, thereby showing that $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{NP}$.\nFurthermore, our algorithm also outputs the number of solutions to the problem\nin polynomial time, thus leading to $\\mathcal{FP} = \\mathcal{\\#P}$. As a bonus,\none important consequence of our results, out of many, is that the\nquantum-polynomial class $\\mathcal{BQP} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$.\n  Not only this, but we show that when multiple solutions exist, they can be\nplaced in certain equivalence classes based on geometric attributes, and be\ncompactly represented by a polynomial sized directed acyclic graph. We show\nthat the Subset Sum Problem has two aspects, namely a combinatorial aspect and\na relational aspect, and that it is the latter which is the primary determiner\nof complexity. We reveal a surprising connection between the size of the\nelements and their number, and the precise way in which they affect the\ncomplexity. In particular, we show that for all instances of the Subset Sum\nProblem, the complexity is independent of the size of elements, once the\ndifference between consecutive elements exceeds $\\lceil{7\\log{}n}\\rceil$ bits\nin size.\n  We provide some numerical examples to illustrate the algorithm, and also show\nhow it can be used to estimate some difficult combinatorial quantities such as\nthe number of restricted partitions."}

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism.

As an alternative, partial label learning offers a\ncost-effective approach, where a set of possible labels is provided instead of\nexact weak annotations. However, partial label learning for audio analysis\nremains largely unexplored. Motivated by the observation that acoustic scenes\nprovide contextual information for constructing a set of possible sound events,\nwe utilize acoustic scene information to construct partial labels of sound\nevents. On the basis of this idea, in this paper, we propose a multitask\nlearning framework that jointly performs acoustic scene classification and\nsound event detection with partial labels of sound events. While reducing\nannotation costs, weakly-supervised and partial label learning often suffer\nfrom decreased detection performance due to lacking the precise event set and\ntheir temporal annotations. To better balance between annotation cost and\ndetection performance, we also explore a semi-supervised framework that\nleverages both strong and partial labels. Moreover, to refine partial labels\nand achieve better model training, we propose a label refinement method based\non self-distillation for the proposed approach with partial labels."}

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken.

Notably, only a small subset of the\ntotal reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's\nprediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning\nsteps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.\nFurthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.\nBy steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform\nor disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we\nhighlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be\ndecorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the\nTrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting\nin a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often\nverbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which\nundermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT."}

Traditional\napproaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits\nthe opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection\nand prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may\nindicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing\naccessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as\ntraditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to\npredict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to\na more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take\nprecautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications."}

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that\nintegrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more\ninterpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex\nenvironments."}

To tackle this issue, we develop a novel Bayesian\ninference approach based on black box variational inference, utilizing\nimportance sampling to reuse existing simulation model calls in the variational\nobjective gradient estimation, without relying on forward model gradients. The\nnovelty lies in a new batch-sequential sampling procedure, which only requires\nnew model evaluations if the currently available model evaluations fail to\nyield a suitable approximation of the objective gradient.

However, existing methods still struggle to\nachieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free\n(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by\nproviding fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require\nextensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their\naccessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling\nimage generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over\nfacial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that\nenables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity\npreservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model\nto extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$\nlatent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model\nwith a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial\nidentity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,\nensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the\nFFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with\nfine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional\nfine-tuning or training data for individual identities.

As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel\nfor transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a\nmodular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through\nan agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception\nagent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively\ndistill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs)\ntailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM,\nwhich serves as a reasoning agent.

This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

Here, we present\nProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in\ncomplex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core\ncomponents: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and\ntheory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and\nProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in\nsocio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how\nto intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite\nof metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator\neffectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a\nsystematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of\nproactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially\nintelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,\nbetter-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social\nmediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the\ngeneric baseline (10.65\\% vs 7.01\\%) while being 77\\% faster in response\n(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,\ntheory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially\nintelligent agents."}

This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation\nof high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.\n1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve\nthe target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since\nthe model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its\nperformance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become\nbiased towards the generated data.\n  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original\nrectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into\nthe training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method\neffectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we\ndemonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much\nsmaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved\nsignificantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in\nfull-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the\noriginal method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids\nsaturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE\nlearning while preserving the distribution of real images."}

However, most previous methods\nusually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects\nand gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both\nthe training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an\nauxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization\nacross the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this\nend, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and\ngaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors\nduring inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded\nspecific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,\nwhich extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using\nthe shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared\nbackbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain\nhead-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head\ndetection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing\nthe gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense\nfeature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the\nsuboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,\nwe propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the\ngaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity\nover Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to\nvariations between bounding boxes.

Increasingly, algorithmic agents don't just\nselect from the range of human created alternatives, but also they create.\nBurgeoning algorithmic agents are capable of providing us with content made\njust for us, and engage with us through one-of-a-kind, personalized\ninteractions. Studying these algorithmic agents presents a host of\nmethodological, ethical, and logistical challenges. The objectives of our paper\nare two-fold. The first aim is to describe one possible approach to researching\nthe individual and societal effects of algorithmic recommenders, and to share\nour experiences with the academic community. The second is to contribute to a\nmore fundamental discussion about the ethical and legal issues of \"tracking the\ntrackers\", as well as the costs and trade-offs involved. Our paper will\ncontribute to the discussion on the relative merits, costs and benefits of\ndifferent approaches to ethically and legally sound research on algorithmic\ngovernance. We will argue that besides shedding light on how users interact\nwith algorithmic agents, we also need to be able to understand how different\nmethods of monitoring our algorithmically controlled digital environments\ncompare to each other in terms of costs and benefits. We conclude our article\nwith a number of concrete suggestions for how to address the practical, ethical\nand legal challenges of researching algorithms and their effects on users and\nsociety."}

While they\nhave also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the\nhallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior\nstudies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce\nbibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is\ngenerated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear\nin the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume\ncitation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency\nwith which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the\npretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated\nreferences in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified\n100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured\nfactual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic\nmetadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across\nresearch domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual\naccuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly\nmemorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction."}

To identify these\nchallenges, we study developer discussions on Stack Overflow, the world's\nlargest developer-focused Q and A platform with about 60 million questions and\nanswers and 30 million users. We construct a taxonomy of developer challenges\nthrough tag expansion and filtering, apply LDA-MALLET for topic modeling, and\nmanually validate and label the resulting themes. Our analysis reveals seven\nmajor areas of recurring issues encompassing 77 distinct technical challenges\nrelated to runtime integration, dependency management, orchestration\ncomplexity, and evaluation reliability. We further quantify topic popularity\nand difficulty to identify which issues are most common and hardest to resolve,\nmap the tools and programming languages used in agent development, and track\ntheir evolution from 2021 to 2025 in relation to major AI model and framework\nreleases.

Prior work often analyzes Frobenius\nnorm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or\nunder-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,\ncaptures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility\nguarantees.

For example, face\nauthentication systems use modern ML models to compute embedding vectors from\nface images of the enrolled users and store them. If leaked, inversion attacks\ncan accurately reconstruct user faces from the leaked vectors. There is no\nsystematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against\nmodel inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face\nauthentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of\nbest-effort solutions.\n  In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong\ndefense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the\ncryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy\nextractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication. We do so\nthrough a new model inversion attack called PIPE, which achieves a success rate\nof over 89% in most cases against prior schemes. We then propose L2FE-Hash, the\nfirst candidate fuzzy extractor which supports standard Euclidean distance\ncomparators as needed in many ML-based applications, including face\nauthentication. We formally characterize its computational security guarantees,\neven in the extreme threat model of full breach of stored secrets, and\nempirically show its usable accuracy in face authentication for practical face\ndistributions. It offers attack-agnostic security without requiring any\nre-training of the ML model it protects.

Existing\ntools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization\nworkflows in particular. In this paper we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code,\nconfiguration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are\ndeclared in human-readable configuration, a workflow orchestrator runs\nstandardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts,\nsuch as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned.

In\nparticular, we (1) show that ReFlow in the protein domain is particularly\nsensitive to the choice of coupling generation and annealing, (2) demonstrate\nhow useful design choices for ReFlow in the image domain do not directly\ntranslate to better performance on proteins, and (3) make improvements to\nReFlow methodology for proteins."}

This complements the previous result\n$O(d\\log(d)/\\varepsilon)$ by van Apeldoorn, Cornelissen, Gily\\'en, and\nNannicini (SODA 2023), which requires both forward and inverse queries.\nMoreover, our result implies a query upper bound\n$O(\\min\\{d^{3/2}/\\varepsilon,1/\\varepsilon^2\\})$ for inverse-free amplitude\nestimation, improving the previous best upper bound\n$O(\\min\\{d^{2}/\\varepsilon,1/\\varepsilon^2\\})$ based on optimal unitary\nestimation by Haah, Kothari, O'Donnell, and Tang (FOCS 2023), and disproving a\nconjecture posed in Tang and Wright (2025)."}
