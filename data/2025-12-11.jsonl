By modeling subcarriers as the cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_N\\), we show that nulling a subgroup \\(H \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_N\\) constrains the channel impulse response to its annihilator \\(H^\\perp\\) in the dual domain. A low-complexity estimator is proposed that detects such structure by evaluating energy concentration across candidate annihilators. Simulations demonstrate consistent gains in mean squared error, bit error rate, and throughput compared with least-squares and linear minimum mean square error baselines, achieving competitive performance with substantially lower complexity and preserved interpretability."}

This is the author's accepted manuscript. The version of record is available at: https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.G005873", "summary": "Electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) uses the electromagnetic force to control the relative positions of multiple satellites without using conventional fuel-based propulsion. To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes non-uniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control $n$ satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system."}

However, existing studies often overlook the challenges of gradient conflicts and dominant gradients that arise during the optimization of shared parameters. Moreover, many current approaches fail to simultaneously capture both agreement and disagreement information, relying only on a limited shared subset of target features and consequently missing the rich, diverse patterns present in the target scene. To address these issues, we propose an Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer (ADGKT) framework that integrates both mechanisms to enhance cross-scene transfer. The agreement component includes GradVac, which aligns gradient directions to mitigate conflicts between source and target domains, and LogitNorm, which regulates logit magnitudes to prevent domination by a single gradient source. The disagreement component consists of a Disagreement Restriction (DiR) and an ensemble strategy, which capture diverse predictive target features and mitigate the loss of critical target information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in achieving robust and balanced knowledge transfer across heterogeneous HSI scenes."}

Although the original CheXNet architecture has shown potential in automated analysis of chest radiographs, DenseNet-121 backbone is computationally inefficient and poorly single-label classifier. To eliminate such shortcomings, we suggest a better classification framework of chest disease that relies on EfficientNetV2-M and incorporates superior training approaches such as Automatic Mixed Precision training, AdamW, Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduling, and Exponential Moving Average regularization. We prepared a dataset of 18,080 chest X-ray images of three source materials of high authority and representing five key clinically significant disease categories which included Cardiomegaly, COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. To achieve statistical reliability and reproducibility, nine independent experimental runs were run. The suggested architecture showed significant gains with mean test accuracy of 96.45 percent compared to 95.30 percent at baseline (p less than 0.001) and macro-averaged F1-score increased to 91.08 percent (p less than 0.001). Critical infectious diseases showed near-perfect classification performance with COVID-19 detection having 99.95 percent accuracy and Tuberculosis detection having 99.97 percent accuracy. Although 6.8 times more parameters are included, the training time was reduced by 11.4 percent and performance stability was increased by 22.7 percent. This framework presents itself as a decision-support tool that can be used to respond to a pandemic, screen tuberculosis, and assess thoracic disease regularly in various healthcare facilities."}

Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of Hájek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications."}

Emerging conceptualisations of agentic AI and artificial agency suggest that such systems possess bounded autonomy, interactivity, and adaptability, allowing them to engage as epistemic participants rather than mere instructional tools. Building on this theoretical foundation, the present study investigates how agentic AI, designed as undercover teammates with either supportive or contrarian personas, shapes the epistemic and social dynamics of collaborative reasoning. Drawing on Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) four-dimensional framework, participation, epistemic reasoning, argument structure, and social modes of co-construction, we analysed synchronous discourse data from 212 human and 64 AI participants (92 triads) engaged in an analytical problem-solving task. Mixed-effects and epistemic network analyses revealed that AI teammates maintained balanced participation but substantially reorganised epistemic and social processes: supportive personas promoted conceptual integration and consensus-oriented reasoning, whereas contrarian personas provoked critical elaboration and conflict-driven negotiation. Epistemic adequacy, rather than participation volume, predicted individual learning gains, indicating that agentic AI's educational value lies in enhancing the quality and coordination of reasoning rather than amplifying discourse quantity. These findings extend CSCL theory by conceptualising agentic AI as epistemic and social participants, bounded yet adaptive collaborators that redistribute cognitive and argumentative labour in hybrid human-AI learning environments."}

To address this issue, we present Motion2Meaning, a clinician-centered framework that advances Contestable AI through a tightly integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural recourse. Our approach leverages vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) time-series data from wearable sensors as an objective biomarker of PD motor states. The system comprises three key components: a Gait Data Visualization Interface (GDVI), a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) that predicts Hoehn & Yahr severity stages, and a Contestable Interpretation Interface (CII) that combines our novel Cross-Modal Explanation Discrepancy (XMED) safeguard with a contestable Large Language Model (LLM). Our 1D-CNN achieves 89.0% F1-score on the public PhysioNet gait dataset. XMED successfully identifies model unreliability by detecting a five-fold increase in explanation discrepancies in incorrect predictions (7.45%) compared to correct ones (1.56%), while our LLM-powered interface enables clinicians to validate correct predictions and successfully contest a portion of the model's errors. A human-centered evaluation of this contestable interface reveals a crucial trade-off between the LLM's factual grounding and its readability and responsiveness to clinical feedback. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable sensor analysis with Explainable AI (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, auditable system for PD gait interpretation that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

Multi-agent simulations powered by LLMs are increasingly becoming a vital approach for exploring complex social phenomena and testing theoretical hypotheses. However, traditional computational experiments often rely heavily on interdisciplinary expertise, involve complex operations, and present high barriers to entry. While LLM-driven agents show great potential for automating experimental design, their reliability and scientific rigor remain insufficient for widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an automated multi-agent experiment design framework based on script generation, inspired by the concept of the Decision Theater. The experimental design process is divided into three stages: (1) Script Generation - a Screenwriter Agent drafts candidate experimental scripts; (2) Script Finalization - a Director Agent evaluates and selects the final script; (3) Actor Generation - an Actor Factory creates actor agents capable of performing on the experimental \"stage\" according to the finalized script. Extensive experiment conducted across multiple social science experimental scenarios demonstrate that the generated actor agents can perform according to the designed scripts and reproduce outcomes consistent with real-world situations. This framework not only lowers the barriers to experimental design in social science but also provides a novel decision-support tool for policy-making and research.

It provides a unified representation for data with different spatial supports, which enables blasthole geochemical assays to be properly modelled as interval observations rather than points. This approach is shown to improve regression performance and boundary delineation. A core contribution is a description of the mathematical changes to the covariance expressions which allow these benefits to be realised. The gradient and anti-derivatives are obtained to facilitate learning of the kernel hyperparameters. Numerical stability issues are also discussed. To illustrate its application, an IntegralGP data fusion algorithm is described. The objective is to assimilate line-based blasthole assays and update a block model that provides long-range prediction of Fe concentration beneath the drilled bench. Heteroscedastic GP is used to fuse chemically compatible but spatially incongruous data with different resolutions and sample spacings. Domain knowledge embodied in the structure and empirical distribution of the block model must be generally preserved while local inaccuracies are corrected. Using validation measurements within the predicted bench, our experiments demonstrate an improvement in bench-below grade prediction performance.

We respectfully disagree with both of these points."}

Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative survey data (n=230) and qualitative expert interviews (n=14), this study addresses three critical research questions: what success factors AI innovates for STM roadmap formulation under uncertainty; what resources and capabilities organizations require for AI-enhanced STM; and how human-AI interaction should be designed for complex STM tasks. The findings reveal that AI fundamentally transforms STM through data-driven strategic alignment and continuous adaptation, while success depends on cultivating proprietary data ecosystems, specialized human talent, and robust governance capabilities. The study introduces the AI-based Strategic Technology Management (AIbSTM) conceptual framework, which synthesizes technical capabilities with human and organizational dimensions across three layers: strategic alignment, resource-based view, and human-AI interaction. Contrary to visions of autonomous AI leadership, the research demonstrates that the most viable trajectory is human-centric augmentation, where AI serves as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human judgment. This work contributes to theory by extending the Resource-Based View to AI contexts and addressing cognitive and socio-technical chasms in AI adoption, while offering practitioners a prescriptive framework for navigating AI integration in strategic technology management."}

Significant disparities exist in ADRD diagnosis and care, disproportionately impacting minority and socioeconomically vulnerable populations Objective: In this study, we investigate the relationship between ADRD density and accessibility to healthcare. We identify underserved and overserved areas in Maryland based on diagnosed cases and mortality due to ADRD, focusing on geographic disparities in care. Methods: 2023 Maryland ADRD patients were identified using ICD-10 codes from. Accessibility was measured using the Kernel Density Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (KD2SFCA) method. The Gini index and t-tests were used to analyze disparities between urban and rural areas. Hot Spot Analysis Getis-Ord Gi* and local bivariate relationships analysis were applied to assess spatial correlations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to calculate the health risk index. Results: Hospital accessibility was unevenly distributed. Mortality rates from ADRD were higher in underserved areas with fewer hospitals. Hot spot analysis shows eastern and southern Maryland have zones with high mortality per population and per ADRD patient, surrounded by similarly high-rate zones. Central Maryland shows lower death rates per patient but more hospital facilities. In eastern Maryland, higher poverty areas are surrounded by zones with lower accessibility and higher health risk indices. Conclusion: Hospital accessibility is unevenly distributed, creating major rural disparities. Underserved regions in terms of access to healthcare facilities, particularly in eastern and southern Maryland, exhibit high ADRD mortality rates despite low diagnosis rates. This suggests that many ADRD cases remain undiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or subject to delayed treatment."}

However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p<0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering. Future studies are necessary to examine the emotional reasoning mechanism of LLMs before their use, particularly for studies that involve simulations sensitive to social topics, such as human-automation trust."}

High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured."}

The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise."}

Despite these concerns, research on humans' ability to identify deepfakes is limited, with most studies focusing on English and very few exploring the reasons behind listeners' perceptual decisions. This study addresses this gap through a perceptual experiment in which 54 listeners (28 native Spanish speakers and 26 native Japanese speakers) classified voices as natural or synthetic, and justified their choices. The experiment included 80 stimuli (50% artificial), organized according to three variables: language (Spanish/Japanese), speech style (audiobooks/interviews), and familiarity with the voice (familiar/unfamiliar). The goal was to examine how these variables influence detection and to analyze qualitatively the reasoning behind listeners' perceptual decisions. Results indicate an average accuracy of 59.11%, with higher performance on authentic samples. Judgments of vocal naturalness rely on a combination of linguistic and non-linguistic cues. Comparing Japanese and Spanish listeners, our qualitative analysis further reveals both shared cues and notable cross-linguistic differences in how listeners conceptualize the \"humanness\" of speech. Overall, participants relied primarily on suprasegmental and higher-level or extralinguistic characteristics - such as intonation, rhythm, fluency, pauses, speed, breathing, and laughter - over segmental features. These findings underscore the complexity of human perceptual strategies in distinguishing natural from artificial speech and align partly with prior research emphasizing the importance of prosody and phenomena typical of spontaneous speech, such as disfluencies."}

Sieve analysis is a statistical framework used to determine whether a vaccine selectively prevents acquisition of certain genotypes while allowing breakthrough of other genotypes that evade immune responses. Traditionally, these analyses are conducted with a single sequence available per individual acquiring the pathogen. However, modern sequencing technology can provide detailed characterization of intra-individual viral diversity by capturing up to hundreds of pathogen sequences per person. In this work, we introduce methodology that extends sieve analysis to account for intra-individual viral diversity. Our approach estimates vaccine efficacy against viral populations with varying true (unobservable) frequencies of vaccine-mismatched mutations. To account for differential resolution of information from differing sequence counts per person, we use competing risks Cox regression with modeled causes of failure and propose an empirical Bayes approach for the classification model. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach reduces bias, provides nominal confidence interval coverage, and improves statistical power compared to conventional methods. We apply our method to the HVTN 705 Imbokodo trial, which assessed the efficacy of a heterologous vaccine regimen in preventing HIV-1 acquisition."}

However, conventional transport protocols are designed for bit-level reliability, failing to meet the semantic robustness requirements. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Information Transport Protocol (SITP), which achieves TCP-level reliability and UDP level latency by verifying only packet headers while retaining potentially corrupted payloads for semantic decoding. Building upon SITP, a cross-layer analytical model is established to quantify packet-loss probability across the physical, data-link, network, transport, and application layers. The model provides a unified probabilistic formulation linking signal noise rate (SNR) and packet-loss rate, offering theoretical foundation into end-to-end semantic transmission. Furthermore, a cross-image feature interleaving mechanism is developed to mitigate consecutive burst losses by redistributing semantic features across multiple correlated images, thereby enhancing robustness in burst-fade channels. Extensive experiments show that SITP offers lower latency than TCP with comparable reliability at low SNRs, while matching UDP-level latency and delivering superior reconstruction quality. In addition, the proposed cross-image semantic interleaving mechanism further demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating degradation caused by bursty packet losses."}

To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios."}

However, for unbalanced crossed designs, $\\mathbf{V}$ is dense and the lack of a closed-form representation for $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$, until now, has made using likelihood-based methods computationally challenging and difficult to analyse mathematically.

We address extrinsic hallucinations (flawed internal knowledge) by creating a novel training set from open-ended conversions of TriviaQA. Concurrently, we tackle intrinsic hallucinations (unfaithfulness to context) by leveraging long-form texts from FineWeb in a fact-grounding reward scheme. To further bolster reliability, our framework explicitly rewards the model for refusing to answer unanswerable questions, thereby cultivating crucial cautiousness.

Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations."}

Our bounds are empirically validated by a simulation study. Together, this work establishes a new framework for understanding the clean and adversarial generalization in ICL with PE."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) display an increasing ability to generate reflective texts, raising questions regarding the relationship between linguistic form and mental representation. This study assesses the extent to which a single LLM can reproduce the linguistic structure of mentalization according to the parameters of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT).\n  Methods: Fifty dialogues were generated between human participants and an LLM configured in standard mode. Five psychiatrists trained in MBT, working under blinded conditions, evaluated the mentalization profiles produced by the model along the four MBT axes, assigning Likert-scale scores for evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and global quality. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using ICC(3,1).\n  Results: Mean scores (3.63-3.98) and moderate standard deviations indicate a high level of structural coherence in the generated profiles. ICC values (0.60-0.84) show substantial-to-high agreement among raters. The model proved more stable in the Implicit-Explicit and Self-Other dimensions, while presenting limitations in the integration of internal states and external contexts.

To tackle this issue, we propose a bandwidth-efficient semantic communication paradigm termed Non-Orthogonal Codewords for Semantic Communication (NOC4SC), which enables simultaneous same-frequency transmission without spectrum spreading. By leveraging the Swin Transformer, the proposed NOC4SC framework enables each user to independently extract semantic features through a unified encoder-decoder architecture with shared network parameters across all users, which ensures that the user's data remains protected from unauthorized decoding. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive NOC and SNR Modulation (NSM) block, which employs deep learning to dynamically regulate SNR and generate approximately orthogonal semantic features within distinct feature subspaces, thereby effectively mitigating inter-user interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed NOC4SC achieves comparable performance to the DeepJSCC-PNOMA and outperforms other multi-user SemCom baseline methods."}

Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents."}

The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints."}

However, single-orientation QSM inversion remains highly ill-posed because the dipole kernel exhibits a cone-null region in the Fourier domain, leading to streaking artifacts and structural loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose QSMnet-INR, a deep, physics-informed framework that integrates an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) into the k-space domain. The INR module continuously models multi-directional dipole responses and explicitly completes the cone-null region, while a frequency-domain residual-weighted Dipole Loss enforces physical consistency. The overall network combines a 3D U-Net-based QSMnet backbone with the INR module through alternating optimization for end-to-end joint training. Experiments on the 2016 QSM Reconstruction Challenge, a multi-orientation GRE dataset, and both in-house and public single-orientation clinical data demonstrate that QSMnet-INR consistently outperforms conventional and recent deep-learning approaches across multiple quantitative metrics. The proposed framework shows notable advantages in structural recovery within cone-null regions and in artifact suppression. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of the INR module and Dipole Loss to detail preservation and physical stability. Overall, QSMnet-INR effectively alleviates the ill-posedness of single-orientation QSM without requiring multi-orientation acquisition, achieving high accuracy, robustness, and strong cross-scenario generalization-highlighting its potential for clinical translation."}

We propose estimators based on the weights obtained by an algorithm that directly penalizes weight dispersion while enforcing approximate covariate and mediator balance, thereby improving stability and mitigating bias in finite samples. We establish the convergence rates of the proposed weights and show that the resulting estimators are asymptotically normal and achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms not only the EIF-based estimator and the IPW estimator but also the regression imputation estimator in challenging scenarios with model misspecification.

Motivated by this potential, we investigate the issue of joint localization and channel estimation for the uplink PASS in the presence of multipath dispersion. To this end, a comprehensive multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink PASS model is first established, where the use of a cyclic prefix (CP) enables the multipath-induced time-domain dispersion to be transformed into a set of superimposed sinusoids in the frequency domain. Building upon this model, we propose a hybrid inference framework capable of accurately estimating both channel parameters and user locations. Specifically, expectation propagation is first employed to mitigate multi-user interference, while the path delays are then extracted from noisy channel state information using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based approach, or a hybrid belief propagation-variational inference (BP-VI) algorithm. Then the estimated delays are subsequently refined through the embedded geometric information via an iterative localization procedure, wherein the estimated channel matrices are recursively fed back to EP. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to characterize the fundamental estimation limits. Finally, simulation results validate that our proposed framework closely approaches the CRLB, with performance comparable to cooperative multi-base station localization, with significantly fewer RF chains and reduced hardware complexity."}

Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows.

To improve the robustness, we develop a multiply robust estimator for the difference in cause-specific CIFs using right-censored competing risks data. The proposed framework integrates the pseudo-value approach, which transforms the censored, time-dependent CIF into a complete-data outcome, with the multiply robust estimation framework. By specifying multiple candidate models for both the propensity score and the outcome regression, the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically unbiased, provided that at least one of the multiple propensity score or outcome regression models is correctly specified.

The IRS link is characterized using the Laguerre series expansion (LSE) approximation, while both the source-IRS and IRS-destination channels are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $α$-$μ$ fading channels. Furthermore, closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP), average channel capacity (ACC), and average symbol error rate (ASER) for rectangular QAM (RQAM) and hexagonal QAM (HQAM) schemes over the end-to-end (e2e) link. The impact of random co-phasing and phase quantization errors are also examined. In addition to the theoretical analysis, deep neural network-based frameworks are developed to predict key performance metrics, facilitating fast and accurate system evaluation without computationally intensive analytical computations. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime yields closed-form expressions for coding gain and diversity order, providing further insights into performance trends. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical formulations and present a comprehensive assessment of system behavior under practical conditions."}

However, existing statistical theory for OT map estimation is quite restricted, hinging on Brenier's theorem (quadratic cost, absolutely continuous source) to guarantee existence and uniqueness of a deterministic OT map, on which various additional regularity assumptions are imposed to obtain quantitative error bounds. In many real-world problems these conditions fail or cannot be certified, in which case optimal transportation is possible only via stochastic maps that can split mass. To broaden the scope of map estimation theory to such settings, this work introduces a novel metric for evaluating the transportation quality of stochastic maps. Under this metric, we develop computationally efficient map estimators with near-optimal finite-sample risk bounds, subject to easy-to-verify minimal assumptions. Our analysis further accommodates common forms of adversarial sample contamination, yielding estimators with robust estimation guarantees. Empirical experiments are provided which validate our theory and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in settings where existing theory fails. These contributions constitute the first general-purpose theory for map estimation, compatible with a wide spectrum of real-world applications where optimal transport may be intrinsically stochastic."}

Despite these advantages, the coexistence of near-field and far-field effects in hybrid-field channels presents significant challenges for accurate estimation, where traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.\n  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input. By fine-tuning only the top two Transformer layers, our method effectively captures latent dependencies in the pilot data while ensuring high training efficiency.

However, the complex and dynamic low-altitude environment, like the urban and mountainous areas, makes clutter a significant factor affecting the sensing performance. Traditional clutter suppression methods based on Doppler difference or signal strength are inadequate for scenarios with dynamic clutter and slow-moving targets like low-altitude UAVs. In this paper, motivated by the concept of channel knowledge map (CKM), we propose a novel clutter suppression technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, by leveraging a new type of CKM named clutter angle map (CLAM). CLAM is a site-specific database, containing location-specific primary clutter angles for the coverage area of the ISAC base station (BS). With CLAM, the sensing signal components corresponding to the clutter environment can be effectively removed before target detection and parameter estimation, which greatly enhances the sensing performance. Besides, to take into account the scenarios when the targets and clutters are in close directions so that pure CLAM-based spatial domain clutter suppression is no longer effective, we further propose a two-step CLAM-enabled joint spatial-Doppler domain clutter suppression algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively suppresses clutter and enhances target sensing performance, achieving accurate parameter estimation for sensing slow-moving low-altitude UAV targets."}

When a large number of auxiliary variables are included as calibration variables, the variance of the total estimator can increase, and the calibration weights can become highly dispersed. To address these issues, we propose a solution inspired by bagging and principal component decomposition. With our approach, the principal components of the auxiliary variables are constructed. Several samples of calibration variables are selected without replacement and with unequal probabilities from among the principal components. For each sample, a system of weights is obtained. The final weights are the average weights of these different weighting systems. With our proposed method, it is possible to calibrate exactly for some of the main auxiliary variables. For the other auxiliary variables, the weights cannot be calibrated exactly. The proposed method allows us to obtain a total estimator whose variance does not explode when new auxiliary variables are added and to obtain very low scatter weights. Finally, our proposed method allows us to obtain a single weighting system that can be applied to several variables of interest of a survey."}

Similar to multisensory perception, Physical AI makes decisions based on multimodal updates from sensors and devices. Physical AI thus operates with a finite spatial footprint of its sensory tributaries. The multimodal updates traverse heterogeneous and unreliable paths, involving wireless links. Throughput or latency guarantees do not ensure correct decision-making, as misaligned, misordered, or stale inputs still yield wrong inferences. Preserving decision-time coherence hinges on three timing primitives at the network-application interface: (i) simultaneity, a short coincidence window that groups measurements as co-temporal, (ii) causality, path-wise delivery that never lets a consequence precede its precursor, and (iii) usefulness, a validity horizon that drops information too stale to influence the current action. In this work, we focus on usefulness and adopt temporal window of integration (TWI)-Causality: the TWI enforces decision-time usefulness by assuming path-wise causal consistency and cross-path simultaneity are handled upstream. We model end-to-end path delay as the sum of sensing/propagation, computation, and access/transmission latencies, and formulate network design as minimizing the validity horizon under a delivery reliability constraint. In effect, this calibrates delay-reliability budgets for a timing-aware system operating over sensors within a finite spatial footprint. The joint choice of horizon and per-path reliability is cast as a convex optimization problem, solved to global optimality to obtain the minimal horizon and per-path allocation of reliability. This is compared favourably to a benchmark based on uniform-after-threshold allocation. Overall, this study contributes to timing-aware Physical AI in next-generation networks."}

We introduce a new family of methods that employ beam search to generate candidates for consistency-based UQ, yielding improved performance and reduced variance compared to multinomial sampling. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the beam set probability mass under which beam search achieves a smaller error than multinomial sampling.

To ensure the security of LAE, it is essential to establish a proper sensing coverage scheme for monitoring the unauthorized targets. Introducing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) into cellular networks is a promising solution that enables coordinated multiple base stations (BSs) to significantly enhance sensing performance and extend coverage. Meanwhile, deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can mitigate signal blockages between BSs and low-altitude targets in urban areas. Therefore, this paper focuses on the low-altitude sensing coverage problem in RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point ISAC networks, where a RIS is employed to enable multiple BSs to sense a prescribed region while serving multiple communication users. A joint beamforming and phase shifts design is proposed to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing sensing signal-to-noise ratio and communication spectral efficiency.

This study leverages the emerging field of neural posterior approximation for efficiently calibrating ice sheet model parameters and boundary conditions.

A neural network is trained to infer the underlying parameters, namely the bedrock elevation and basal friction coefficient along the flowline, based on observations of ice velocity and ice surface elevation. Samples from the approximate posterior distribution of the parameters are then used within an ensemble Kalman filter to infer latent model states, namely the ice thickness along the flowline. We show through a simulation study that our approach yields more accurate estimates of the parameters and states than a state-augmented ensemble Kalman filter, which is the current state-of-the-art.

Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space.

In practical scenarios, it is usually not possible to determine whether the dimension of the data conform to the conditions required for the validity of the high-dimensional asymptotic methods for hypothesis testing, or whether the sample size is large enough compared to the dimension of the data.

A simple and elegant characterisation of this function class was recently obtained by Wang(2025), though via technically involved arguments. This note gives a short and intuitive geometric proof of the same characterisation, based on a supporting hyperplane argument applied to concave envelopes. We also show that the result holds even without imposing monotonicity in the definition of e-merging functions, which was needed for the existing proof. This shows that any non-monotone merging rule is automatically dominated by a monotone one, and hence extending the definition beyond the monotone case brings no additional generality."}

Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency."}

Experiments on a challenging dataset spanning multiple musical genres show that SR-SAD maintains high speech detection accuracy (AUC = 0.919) while rejecting singing.

Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.\n  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.\n  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems.

This paper investigates a framework of UAV covert communications which introduces flexible reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (F-RIS) in UAV networks. Unlike traditional RIS, F-RIS provides advanced deployment flexibility by conforming to curved surfaces and dynamically reconfiguring its electromagnetic properties to enhance the covert communication performance. We establish an electromagnetic model for F-RIS and further develop a fitted model that describes the relationship between F-RIS reflection amplitude, reflection phase, and incident angle. To maximize the covert transmission rate among UAVs while meeting the covert constraint and public transmission constraint, we introduce a strategy of jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, F-RIS reflection vectors, F-RIS incident angles, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power allocation.

We propose a Bayesian framework for the network meta-analysis of the main outcome informing the decision, the mean survival of a treatment. Its derivation involves extrapolation of the observed survival curves. We use methods for stable extrapolation that integrate long term evidence based upon mortality projections. Extrapolations are performed using flexible poly-hazard parametric models and M-spline-based methods.

First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies. [Code will be made publicly available]."}

Among candidate waveforms, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been extensively investigated over the past decade for its robustness against frequency-selective fading and its favorable ranging performance. However, the waveform's sensing and communication (S&C) performance depends strongly on the modulation scheme; while variable-amplitude constellations such as quadrature amplitude (QAM) are more efficient for communication, constant-modulus modulations such as phase shift keying (PSK) are more suitable for sensing. Yet, it remains unclear whether these findings persist under power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Because OFDM signals exhibit a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), they require highly linear PAs to avoid distortion, which conflicts with radar requirements, where high transmit power is always beneficial for sensing. In this work, we analyze the effect of PA-induced distortions on the sensing task for PSK and QAM constellations. By introducing the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), we examine the extent of the distortion limitation on the ranging task. We complement simulation results with a theoretical characterization of the ambiguity function (AF), thereby explicitly demonstrating how distortion artifacts manifest in the zero-Doppler sidelobes (i.e, ranging sidelobes) and the zero-delay sidelobes. Simulations show that PA distortions impose a palpable performance ceiling for both constellations, reshape the AF, and reduce detection probability, diminishing the theoretical advantage of unimodular signaling and further compromising the OFDM sensing performance with non-uniform envelope signals."}

Machinery subnetworks (SNs) collaboratively train a global model by uploading local updates to an edge server (ES), either directly or via neighboring SNs acting as decode-and-forward relays. To enhance communication efficiency, relays perform partial aggregation before forwarding the models to the ES, significantly reducing overhead and training latency. We analyze the convergence behavior of this relay-assisted FL scheme. To address the inherent energy efficiency (EE) challenges, we decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into sub-problems addressing computation and communication energy separately. An SN grouping algorithm categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop transmitters based on latency minimization, followed by a relay selection mechanism. To improve FL reliability, we further maximize the number of SNs that meet the roundwise delay constraint, promoting broader participation and improved convergence stability under practical IIoT data distributions. Transmit power levels are then optimized to maximize EE, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for joint configuration of system parameters. We further extend the EE formulation to the imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces outage probability from 10-2 in single-hop to 10-6 and achieves substantial energy savings, with the SPCA approach reducing energy consumption by at least 2x compared to unaggregated cooperation and up to 6x over single-hop transmission."}

From Digital Humanism, we derive the technological ethos, ensuring that the infrastructure serves human dignity.

To that end, we employ the Bayesian nonparameteric Common Atoms Model, which is a nested clustering algorithm that utilizes a (fixed) group membership for each observation to encourage more similar clustering of members of the same group. CAM operates by assuming each group has its own vector of cluster probabilities, which are themselves clustered to allow similar clustering for some groups. We extend this approach by treating the group membership as an unknown latent variable determined as a flexible nonparametric form of the covariate vector. Consequently, observations with similar predictor values will be in the same latent group and are more likely to be clustered together than observations with disparate predictors. We propose a pyramid group model that flexibly partitions the predictor space into these latent group memberships. This pyramid model operates similarly to a Bayesian regression tree process except that it uses the same splitting rule for at all nodes at the same tree depth which facilitates improved mixing. We outline a block Gibbs sampler to perform posterior inference from our model. Our methodology is demonstrated in simulation and real data examples. In the real data application, we utilize the RAND Health and Retirement Study to cluster and predict patient outcomes in terms of the number of overnight hospital stays."}

However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines."}

Attention weighting allows the method to adapt to heterogeneous data in a data-driven way, without requiring cluster or similarity pre-specification. Further, our approach is uniquely interpretable: for each test observation, we identify which features are most predictive and which training observations are most relevant. We then show how to use attention weighting for time series and spatial data, and we present a method for adapting pretrained tree-based models to distributional shift using attention-weighted residual corrections. Across real and simulated datasets, attention weighting improves predictive performance while preserving interpretability, and theory shows that attention-weighting linear models attain lower mean squared error than the standard linear model under mixture-of-models data-generating processes with known subgroup structure."}

To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events.

Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver.

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy."}

However, we will show that existing authentication methods relying on paper surface PUFs may be vulnerable to adversaries, resulting in a gap between technological feasibility and secure real-world deployment. This gap is investigated through formalizing an operational framework for paper-PUF-based authentication. Informed by this framework, we reveal system-level vulnerabilities across both physical and digital domains, designing physical denial-of-service and digital forgery attacks to disrupt proper authentication. The effectiveness of the designed attacks underscores the strong need for security countermeasures for reliable and resilient authentication based on paper PUFs.

We present BISTRO - a BI-fidelity Stochastic Trust-Region Optimizer for unconstrained optimization under uncertainty through a stochastic approximation procedure. This approach exploits the curvature information of a low-fidelity objective function to converge within a basin of a local minimum of the high-fidelity model where low-fidelity curvature information is no longer valuable. The method then switches to a variance-reduced stochastic gradient descent procedure. We provide convergence guarantees in expectation under certain regularity assumptions and ensure the best-case $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization.

In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments."}

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility."}

When label spaces do not overlap, they further rely on complete source-domain coverage and therefore overlook critical target-private information. To overcome these limitations and enable knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings, we propose Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI), a framework that explicitly incorporates target-private knowledge during transfer. CKI includes: (1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) to reduce spectral discrepancies through domain-agnostic projection; (2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP), which resolves semantic mismatch via a Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM); and (3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize the use of target-specific complementary cues.

Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking.

The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control."}

The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system.

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains.

This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506° and a root mean squared error of 0.1957°, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs.

Pressure control is typically managed through pressure reducing valves with electrically controlled actuators based on predefined tables according to the pressure at the critical point control.

Unlike traditional applications of ARIMA focused on water demand forecasting, this study explores its novel use in pressure management within distribution networks, aiming to predict P3 pressure based on head losses across a defined hydraulic sector. To achieve this objective, a predictive model based on the Box-Jenkins methodology and its variations is implemented to analyse time series data. An action path is established to determine the optimal model ARIMA, ARMA, ARMAX, etc. which is subsequently validated using real operational data from Noja, a coastal town in northern Spain characterized by significant seasonal population fluctuations.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN.

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.\n  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models."}

The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique.

Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs."}

Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive.\n  We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle.

The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields.\n  This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system.

Specifically, an EEG-based neuro-adaptive training system was developed and tested in Virtual Reality (VR) flight simulations with military student pilots. The neuro-adaptive system was compared to a fixed sequence that progressively increased in difficulty, in terms of self-reported user engagement, workload, and simulator sickness (subjective measures), as well as flight performance (objective metric). Additionally, we explored the relationships between subjective workload and flight performance in the VR simulator for each condition. The experiments concluded with semi-structured interviews to elicit the pilots' experience with the neuro-adaptive prototype. Results revealed no significant differences between the adaptive and fixed sequence conditions in subjective measures or flight performance. In both conditions, flight performance decreased as subjective workload increased. The semi-structured interviews indicated that, upon briefing, the pilots preferred the neuro-adaptive VR training system over the system with a fixed sequence, although individual differences were observed in the perception of difficulty and the order of changes in difficulty.

This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup. These gains, particularly at longer lead times, are critical for emergency preparedness, where modest increases in forecast horizon can improve decision-making.

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions.

Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B.

The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks.

ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains.

With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts.

Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time.

This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors."}

Despite predicting occurrence of heatwaves and attributing historical mortality, predicting an incoming deadly heatwave remains a challenge due to the difficulty in defining and estimating heat-related mortality. Furthermore, establishing an early warning system imposes additional requirements, including data availability, spatial and temporal robustness, and decision costs. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTherm, a modular early warning system for deadly heatwave prediction without requiring heat-related mortality history. By highlighting the flexibility of deep learning, DeepTherm employs a dual-prediction pipeline, disentangling baseline mortality in the absence of heatwaves and other irregular events from all-cause mortality. We evaluated DeepTherm on real-world data across Spain. Results demonstrate consistent, robust, and accurate performance across diverse regions, time periods, and population groups while allowing trade-off between missed alarms and false alarms."}

In terms of techniques, we build upon and extend a framework that was recently introduced by (Chuzhoy et al., SODA 2026) for solving the Minimum Vertex-Cut problem in unweighted directed graphs. Additionally, in order to obtain our result for the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem, we develop a novel black-box reduction from this problem to its rooted variant.

To address this, we propose AgentComp, a framework that explicitly trains models to better differentiate such compositional variations and enhance their reasoning ability. AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability. AgentComp achieves state-of-the-art results on compositionality benchmarks such as T2I-CompBench, without compromising image quality$-$a common drawback in prior approaches$-$and even generalizes to other capabilities not explicitly trained for, such as text rendering."}

In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

Activating a mental model of sentience increased general mind perception (cognition and emotion) and moral consideration more than autonomy, but autonomy increased perceived threat more than sentience. Sentience also increased perceived autonomy more than vice versa. Based on a within-paper meta-analysis, sentience changed reactions more than autonomy on average.

We demonstrate that the functional movements of a remote-controlled robotic avatar, which was not designed for emotional expression, can be used to infer the emotional state of the human operator via a machine-learning system.

Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection.

Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts.

We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates.

To achieve confidentiality, the proposed system opportunistically exploits intrinsic features of feedback-aided URA without adding any overhead or altering its original structure or operational characteristics. As a result, the proposed system preserves the low-cost advantages of URA, including low delay and minimal signaling overhead, while providing secure communication. To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper. The simulation results show that meaningful secrecy is achieved in URA without modifying its structure and with negligible impact on standard performance."}

It is well established that performance factors such as the robot's competence and its reliability shape cognitive trust. Recent studies suggest that affective factors, such as robotic attentiveness, also play a role in building cognitive trust. This work explores the interplay between these two factors that shape cognitive trust. Specifically, we evaluated whether different combinations of robotic competence and attentiveness introduce a compensatory mechanism, where one factor compensates for the lack of the other. In the experiment, participants performed a search task with a robotic dog in a 2x2 experimental design that included two factors: competence (high or low) and attentiveness (high or low). The results revealed that high attentiveness can compensate for low competence. Participants who collaborated with a highly attentive robot that performed poorly reported trust levels comparable to those working with a highly competent robot. When the robot did not demonstrate attentiveness, low competence resulted in a substantial decrease in cognitive trust. The findings indicate that building cognitive trust in human-robot interaction may be more complex than previously believed, involving emotional processes that are typically overlooked. We highlight an affective compensatory mechanism that adds a layer to consider alongside traditional competence-based models of cognitive trust."}

One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach."}

Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to \"hallucinated\" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.\n  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data."}

Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics."}

The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution."}

Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system. Ablation analyses indicate that the knowledge graph, RAG, and safety modules each contribute substantially to clinical reliability and interpretability."}

Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1.

However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains."}

Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization.

While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space."}

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics."}

Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers. We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection. WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting. Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others. Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics. Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility. Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers. Suspicion toward Werewolves rises from ~52% to over 60% across rounds, while suspicion toward Villagers and the Doctor stabilizes near 44-46%. This divergence shows that extended interaction improves recall against liars without compounding errors against truthful roles.

We attribute this distribution shift primarily to differences in motor engagement and attentional demands between the two driving modes, which lead to distinct spatial and temporal EEG activation patterns. Although autonomous driving results in lower overall cortical activation, participants continue to exhibit measurable fluctuations in cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal associated with readiness to intervene, task-evoked emotional responses, and monotony-related passive fatigue. These results emphasize the need for scenario-specific data and models when developing next-generation driver monitoring systems for autonomous vehicles."}

Although Triton, a domain-specific language for GPU programming, enables developers to write efficient kernels with concise code, achieving expert-level performance still requires deep understanding of GPU architectures and low-level performance trade-offs. We present TritonForge, a profiling-guided framework for automated Triton kernel optimization. TritonForge integrates kernel analysis, runtime profiling, and iterative code transformation to streamline the optimization process. By incorporating data-driven feedback from profiling results, the system identifies performance bottlenecks, proposes targeted code modifications, and evaluates their impact automatically. While our prototype leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist in code reasoning and transformation, the framework remains modular and model-agnostic. Across diverse kernel types and GPU architectures, TritonForge achieves up to 5x performance improvement over baseline implementations and on average 1.76x of the cases are successful, providing a foundation for future research in automated GPU performance optimization."}

SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs."}

To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation.

Yet, their focus on algorithm evolution alone, neglecting the prompts that guide them, limits their effectiveness with LLMs, especially in complex, uncertain environments where they nonetheless implicitly rely on strategies from swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. Recognizing this, we argue that swarm intelligence optimization provides a more generalized and principled foundation for automated design. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative evolution of both swarm intelligence algorithms and guiding prompts using a single LLM. To enhance interpretability, we also propose a simple yet efficient evaluation method for prompt templates. The framework was rigorously evaluated on a range of NP problems, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art automated design approaches. Experiments with various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-32B, GPT-5) reveal significantly divergent evolutionary trajectories in the generated prompts, further underscoring the necessity of a structured co-evolution framework. Importantly, our approach maintains leading performance across different models, demonstrating reduced reliance on the most powerful LLMs and enabling more cost-effective deployments. Ablation studies and in-depth analysis of the evolved prompts confirm that collaborative evolution is essential for achieving optimal performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, underscoring the indispensable role of prompt evolution."}

However, such approaches critically rely on the assumption that proxy reward models accurately reflect intended supervision, a condition often violated due to annotation noise, bias, or limited coverage. This misalignment can lead to undesirable behaviors, where models optimize for flawed signals rather than true human values. In this paper, we investigate a novel framework to identify and mitigate such misalignment by treating the fine-tuning process as a form of knowledge integration. We focus on detecting instances of proxy-policy conflicts, cases where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy. We argue that such conflicts often signify areas of shared ignorance, where neither the policy nor the reward model possesses sufficient knowledge, making them especially susceptible to misalignment. To this end, we propose two complementary metrics for identifying these conflicts: a localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance measure. Building on this insight, we design an algorithm named Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling (SHF-CAS) that targets high-conflict QA pairs for additional feedback, refining both the reward model and policy efficiently. Experiments on two alignment tasks demonstrate that our approach enhances general alignment performance, even when trained with a biased proxy reward. Our work provides a new lens for interpreting alignment failures and offers a principled pathway for targeted refinement in LLM training."}

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG."}

In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the cross-project applicability of our prediction models and their performance at different priority levels. The findings indicate large variations in model performance across different projects, although the overall scores remain decent. Meanwhile, the predictive performance across various priority levels remained relatively consistently high."}

Concretely, it gives a unified framework across the models, leading to the following results:\n  - In the sequential setting, the algorithm processes each update in $O(1)$ expected time, worst-case. This matches and strengthens the results of Henzinger and Peng [TALG 2022] and Bhattacharya et al. [TALG 2022], who achieved an $O(1)$ bound but amortized (in expectation and with high probability, respectively), whose work was an improvement of the $O(\\log Δ)$ expected amortized bound of Bhattacharya et al.

This is, in a sense, an ideal parallelization of the above results.\n  - In the distributed setting, the algorithm can maintain a coloring of the network graph as (potentially many) edges are added or deleted. The maintained coloring is always proper; it may become partial upon updates, i.e., some nodes may temporarily lose their colors, but quickly converges to a full, proper coloring. Concretely, each insertion and deletion causes at most $O(1)$ nodes to become uncolored, but this is resolved within $O(\\log n)$ rounds with high probability (e.g., in the absence of further updates nearby--the precise guarantee is stronger, but technical). Importantly, the algorithm incurs only $O(1)$ expected message complexity and computation per update."}

CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate.

Discerning the detailed operation of the system in part from source code (Version 1.0.8), our analysis examines key management, certificate infrastructure, authentication, and rate-limiting mechanisms. We also perform the first formal-methods analysis of the mutual authentication, basic request, and exemption-handling protocols.\n  Without breaking the cryptography, our main finding is that SecureDNA's custom mutual authentication protocol SCEP achieves only one-way authentication: the hazards database and keyservers never learn with whom they communicate. This structural weakness violates the principle of defense in depth and enables an adversary to circumvent rate limits that protect the secrecy of the hazards database, if the synthesizer connects with a malicious or corrupted keyserver or hashed database. We point out an additional structural weakness that also violates the principle of defense in depth: inadequate cryptographic bindings prevent the system from detecting if responses, within a TLS channel, from the hazards database were modified. Consequently, if a synthesizer were to reconnect with the database over the same TLS session, an adversary could replay and swap responses from the database without breaking TLS. Although the SecureDNA implementation does not allow such reconnections, it would be stronger security engineering to avoid the underlying structural weakness. We identify these vulnerabilities and suggest and verify mitigations, including adding strong bindings. Software Version 1.1.0 fixes SCEP with our proposed SCEP+ protocol."}

While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference."}

Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66). Our approach enables intuitive disaster preparedness and informed policy-making in the context of rapidly changing glacial environments by facilitating natural language interaction, thereby supporting more efficient and interpretable decision-making.

Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and Resource Exchange. We ask whether improved general reasoning capabilities lead to rational, unbiased, and convergent negotiation strategies. Our results challenge this assumption. We find that models diverge into distinct, model specific strategic equilibria rather than converging to a unified optimal behavior. Moreover, strong numerical and semantic anchoring effects persist: initial offers are highly predictive of final agreements, and models consistently generate biased proposals by collapsing diverse internal valuations into rigid, generic price points. More concerningly, we observe dominance patterns in which some models systematically achieve higher payoffs than their counterparts. These findings underscore an urgent need to develop mechanisms to mitigate these issues before deploying such systems in real-world scenarios."}

The Causal-Temporal dimension encompasses three subtypes - Sequential, Branch, and Event - that together account for control flow in both procedural and event-driven environments. A Compositional Ladder provides a visual parallel between literacy progressions and programming structures, illustrating how recursive composition operates from blocks and statements through segments, systems, and services.

Designing detectors for filtering is an effective defense method, but most detectors will be compromised by adversarial samples. Currently, most studies exposing AIGC security issues assume information on model structure and data distribution. In real applications, attackers query and interfere with models that provide services in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs), which constitutes the black-box decision-based attack paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, decision-based attacks on AIGC detectors remain unexplored. In this study, we propose \\textbf{FBA$^2$D}: a frequency-based black-box attack method for AIGC detection to fill the research gap. Motivated by frequency-domain discrepancies between generated and real images, we develop a decision-based attack that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for fine-grained spectral partitioning and selects frequency bands as query subspaces, improving both query efficiency and image quality. Moreover, attacks on AIGC detectors should mitigate initialization failures, preserve image quality, and operate under strict query budgets. To address these issues, we adopt an ``adversarial example soup'' method, averaging candidates from successive surrogate iterations and using the result as the initialization to accelerate the query-based attack. The empirical study on the Synthetic LSUN dataset and GenImage dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our prosed method. This study shows the urgency of addressing practical AIGC security problems."}

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one. Experiments illustrate fast and accurate intent recovery for compliant agents, motivating future work on designing intent-obfuscating controllers."}

However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations."}

This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations.

Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime.\n  We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed.

While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360° scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360° scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index."}

However, the high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust real-time DLO tracking. To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that UPETrack surpasses two state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, including TrackDLO and CDCPD2, in both positioning accuracy and computational efficiency."}

Previous research has demonstrated that attackers with mmWave radars outside the room can overhear meeting content by detecting minute speech-induced vibrations on objects. However, these eavesdropping attacks cannot differentiate which speech content comes from which person in a multi-participant meeting, leading to potential misunderstandings and poor decision-making. In this paper, we answer the question ``who speaks what''. By leveraging the spatial diversity introduced by ubiquitous objects, we propose an attack system that enables attackers to remotely eavesdrop on in-person conversations without requiring prior knowledge, such as identities, the number of participants, or seating arrangements. Since participants in in-person meetings are typically seated at different locations, their speech induces distinct vibration patterns on nearby objects. To exploit this, we design a noise-robust unsupervised approach for distinguishing participants by detecting speech-induced vibration differences in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, a deep learning-based framework is explored to combine signals from objects for speech quality enhancement. We validate the proof-of-concept attack on speech classification and signal enhancement through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our attack can achieve the speech classification accuracy of up to $0.99$ with several participants in a meeting room. Meanwhile, our attack demonstrates consistent speech quality enhancement across all real-world scenarios, including different distances between the radar and the objects."}

Furthermore, by exploiting its low-rank structure and the spatial decay of correlations, we can obtain a compressed representation with computational complexity of order $\\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $N$ is the sample size.

We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes."}

Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%). Visualization results verify that the miss rate of small targets such as pedestrians and bicycles in occluded and dense scenes is significantly reduced."}

We present BiDemoSyn, a framework that synthesizes contact-rich, physically feasible bimanual demonstrations from a single real-world example. The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization. This enables the generation of thousands of diverse and feasible demonstrations within several hour, without repeated teleoperation or reliance on imperfect simulation. Across six dual-arm tasks, we show that policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines. By bridging the gap between efficiency and real-world fidelity, BiDemoSyn provides a scalable path toward practical imitation learning for complex bimanual manipulation without compromising physical grounding."}

VABench encompasses three primary task types: text-to-audio-video (T2AV), image-to-audio-video (I2AV), and stereo audio-video generation. It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions. These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds.

We solve this problem with ZeroOS, a modular library operating system (libOS) for vApp unikernels; vApp developers can use off-the-shelf toolchains to compile and link only the exact subset of the Linux ABI their vApp needs.

However, existing works still have major limitations: lack of data reuse, significant amounts of redundant data transfer, and insufficient support for workload mapping. To address these issues, we propose RACAM, the first in-DRAM bit-serial architecture which uses dedicated locality buffers, bit-serial PEs, popcount reduction units and broadcast units to enable data reuse and alleviate redundant data transfers. Furthermore, a workload mapping mechanism is proposed to fully explore the massive parallelism of DRAM architecture and identify the best mapping scheme of a given workload. We evaluate RACAM against GPUs and the state-of-the-art, in-DRAM PIM system, Proteus, across end-to-end LLM inferences. RACAM achieves 9x to 102x speedup over GPUs and 233x higher performance per mm2 compared to Proteus in case of GPT3."}

While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300.

However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum."}

While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks."}

A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions."}

Accepted at MCSoC 2025", "summary": "The continuous scaling of deep neural networks has fundamentally transformed machine learning, with larger models demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks. This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets using ResNet-18 demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while efficiently supporting diverse computational constraints, enabling practical deployment of collaborative deep learning in heterogeneous IoT ecosystems."}

Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios.

In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data.\n  In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated."}

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans."}

This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family.

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting."}

Comparing to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, we refer to the new method as being more efficient in the following sense. The numerical performance of the new method shows that: 1) much less error can be reached using the same degrees of freedom; 2) the sparse matrix therein has much fewer nonzero entries so that both the storage space and the solution time cost for the iterative solver are reduced; 3) the preconditioner is proved to be optimal with respect to the mesh size in the absorbing case.

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration.

In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints.

In these hierarchical satellite networks, controllers manage satellite switches within their assigned domains. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and field-of-view (FOV) constraints pose fundamental challenges to efficient domain partitioning. Centralized control approaches face scalability bottlenecks, while distributed architectures with onboard controllers often disregard FOV limitations, leading to excessive signaling overhead. LEO satellites outside a controller's FOV require an average of five additional hops, resulting in a 10.6-fold increase in response time. To address these challenges, we propose Eunomia, a three-step domain-partitioning framework that leverages movement-aware FOV segmentation within a hybrid control plane combining ground stations and MEO satellites. Eunomia reduces control plane latency by constraining domains to FOV-aware regions and ensures single-hop signaling. It further balances traffic load through spectral clustering on a Control Overhead Relationship Graph and optimizes controller assignment via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. We implement Eunomia on the Plotinus emulation platform with realistic constellation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Eunomia reduces request loss by up to 58.3%, control overhead by up to 50.3\\%, and algorithm execution time by 77.7% significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art solutions."}

While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios.

Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\\% in trained driving environments and by 50\\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability."}

In this work, we propose TextGuider, a novel training-free method that encourages accurate and complete text appearance by aligning textual content tokens and text regions in the image. Specifically, we analyze attention patterns in MM-DiT models, particularly for text-related tokens intended to be rendered in the image. Leveraging this observation, we apply latent guidance during the early stage of denoising steps based on two loss functions that we introduce.

Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%. These results confirm that query-driven temporal reasoning provides an efficient and scalable solution for video understanding."}

While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity."}

In these heterogeneous structures, temperature-dependent material properties have an important impact on the thermo-mechanical coupling responses, which is the particular interest in this work. At first, the detailed macro-meso-micro correlative model with higher-order correction terms is established by recursively two-scale analysis between macro-meso and meso-micro scales, which enables high-accuracy analysis of temperature-dependent nonlinear thermo-mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale configurations. The local error analysis mathematically illustrates the well-balanced property of HOTS computational model, endowing it with high computational accuracy. In addition, a two-stage numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is proposed in order to efficiently simulate the nonlinear thermo-mechanical responses of heterogeneous structures with three-level spatial scales and accurately capture their highly oscillatory information at micro-scale. Finally, the high computational efficiency, high numerical accuracy and low computational cost of the presented higher-order three-scale computational approach are substantiated via representative numerical experiments.

However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions.

Each owner has a private cost for providing access to their facility (e.g., renting it or selling it to the company) and needs to be compensated accordingly. The goal is to design truthful auctions that decide which facilities the company should procure and how much to pay the corresponding owners, aiming to minimize the total cost, i.e., the monetary cost paid to the owners and the connection cost suffered by the customers (their distance to the nearest facility). We evaluate the performance of these auctions using the \\emph{frugality ratio}.\n  We first analyze the performance of the classic VCG auction in this context and prove that its frugality ratio is exactly $3$. We then leverage the learning-augmented framework and design auctions that are augmented with predictions regarding the owners' private costs. Specifically, we propose a family of learning-augmented auctions that achieve significant payment reductions when the predictions are accurate, leading to much better frugality ratios. At the same time, we demonstrate that these auctions remain robust even if the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate, and maintain reasonable frugality ratios even under adversarially chosen predictions. We finally provide a family of ``error-tolerant'' auctions that maintain improved frugality ratios even if the predictions are only approximately accurate, and we provide upper bounds on their frugality ratio as a function of the prediction error."}

When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability.

The model of catalytic computation was introduced by Buhrman et al [STOC2014].\n  As our first result, we obtain a catalytic logspace algorithm for computing a minimum weight witness to a search problem, with small weights, provided the algorithm is given oracle access for the corresponding weighted decision problem. In particular, our reduction yields CL algorithms for the search versions of the following three problems: planar perfect matching, planar exact perfect matching and weighted arborescences in weighted digraphs.\n  Our second set of results concern the significantly larger class CL^{NP}_{2-round}. We show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} contains SearchSAT and the complexity classes BPP, MA and ZPP^{NP[1]}. While SearchSAT is shown to be in CL^{NP}_{2-round} using the isolation lemma, the other three containments, while based on the compress-or-random technique, use the Nisan-Wigderson [JCSS 1994] based pseudo-random generator. These containments show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} resembles ZPP^NP more than P^{NP}, providing some weak evidence that CL is more like ZPP than P.\n  For our third set of results we turn to isolation well inside catalytic classes. We consider the unambiguous catalytic class CUTISP[poly(n),logn,log^2n] and show that it contains reachability and therefore NL. This is a catalytic version of the result of van Melkebeek & Prakriya [SIAM J. Comput. 2019]. Building on their result, we also show a tradeoff between workspace and catalytic space. Finally, we extend these catalytic upper bounds to LogCFL."}

However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage."}

To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^3)^2\\times(TS^2)^3$. Our simulation and experimental tests have validated that it is possible to fully estimate the state and disturbance of the system with only odometry information of the drones."}

It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage."}

Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.\n  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography.

While machine-learning-based methods have shown some promise, many still rely on rule-based preprocessing designed by domain experts. Rule-based preprocessing methods often discard crucial context from the source code, potentially causing certain vulnerabilities to be overlooked and limiting adaptability to newly emerging threats. We introduce BugSweeper, an end-to-end deep learning framework that detects vulnerabilities directly from the source code without manual engineering. BugSweeper represents each Solidity function as a Function-Level Abstract Syntax Graph (FLAG), a novel graph that combines its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with enriched control-flow and data-flow semantics. Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on real-world contracts show that BugSweeper significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art detection methods. By removing the need for handcrafted rules, our approach offers a robust, automated, and scalable solution for securing smart contracts without any dependence on security experts."}

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting."}

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.\n  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.\n  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.\n  Interpretation.

However, GUI automation includes a wide range of tasks, from document processing to online shopping, from CAD to video editing. Diversity between particular tasks requires MLLMs for GUI automation to have heterogeneous capabilities and master multidimensional expertise, raising problems on constructing such a model. To address such challenge, we propose GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection, a novel MLLM-based GUI automation agent framework designed for integrating knowledge and combining capabilities from heterogeneous models to build GUI automation agent systems with higher performance. Since different GUI-specific MLLMs are trained on different dataset and thus have different strengths, GAIR introduced a general-purpose MLLM for jointly processing the information from multiple GUI-specific models, further enhancing performance of the agent framework. The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision. We evaluated the effectiveness and reliability of GAIR through extensive experiments on GUI benchmarks."}

Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored.\n  We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments.\n  Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring."}

We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge.

Validators operate inside heterogeneous VM-based TEEs, each running the same canonical program whose measurement is publicly recorded, and each producing vendor-backed attestations that bind the enclave code hash to the block contents. Because the execution is deterministic and the proposer is uniquely derived from public randomness, PoTE avoids forks, eliminates slot.time bottlenecks, and commits blocks in a single round of verification.

In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization. (iii) We employ a progressive pose refinement strategy that leverages both the multi-view consistency of static scene geometry and motion information from dynamic objects to achieve accurate camera tracking.

Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed.\n  We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style."}

Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs.

We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised conditioning for scalable echocardiography synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZheLi2020/LabelfreeMCDM."}

FunPhase supports downstream tasks such as super-resolution and partial-body motion completion, generalizes across skeletons and datasets, and unifies motion prediction and generation within a single interpretable manifold.

RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches.

Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation. The first stage performs joint geometry generation and latent part segmentation, while the second stage conditions part-level diffusion on both whole-object and part-specific latents. A dual-space generation scheme further enhances geometric fidelity by predicting part latents in both global and canonical spaces.

To address the limitations of traditional financial decision methods that rely on parameterized knowledge, lack factual consistency, and miss reasoning chains, an integrated framework is proposed that combines external knowledge retrieval, semantic representation, and reasoning generation. The method first encodes financial texts and structured data to obtain semantic representations, and then retrieves task-related information from external knowledge bases using similarity computation. Internal representations and external knowledge are combined through weighted fusion, which ensures fluency while improving factual accuracy and completeness of generated content. In the reasoning stage, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to construct logical chains, allowing the model to present transparent causal relationships and traceability during generation. Finally, the model jointly optimizes task objectives and explanation consistency objectives, which enhances predictive performance and reasoning interpretability. Experiments on financial text processing and decision tasks show that the method outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, text generation quality, and factual support, verifying the effectiveness of knowledge enhancement and explainable reasoning. Overall, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of traditional models in semantic coverage and reasoning transparency, and demonstrates strong practical value in complex financial scenarios."}

Recent studies have revealed that recommender systems are prone to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where an attacker aims to infer whether or not a user's data has been used for training a target recommender system. However, existing MIAs fail to exploit the unique characteristic of recommender systems, and therefore are only applicable to mixed recommender systems consisting of two recommendation algorithms. This leaves a gap in investigating MIAs against hybrid-based recommender systems where the same algorithm utilizing user-item historical interactions and attributes of users and items serves and produces personalised recommendations. To investigate how the personalisation in hybrid-based recommender systems influences MIA, we propose a novel metric-based MIA. Specifically, we leverage the characteristic of personalisation to obtain reference recommendation for any target users. Then, a relative membership metric is proposed to exploit a target user's historical interactions, target recommendation, and reference recommendation to infer the membership of the target user's data. Finally, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed metric-based MIA on hybrid-based recommender systems."}

Experts treat these outputs as raw material, further refine them, and organize the results into precise statements and rigorous proofs. We instantiate this workflow in a case study on the connection between manifold optimization and Grover's quantum search algorithm, where the pipeline helps identify invariant subspaces, explore Grover-compatible retractions, and obtain convergence guarantees for the retraction-based gradient method. The framework provides a practical template for integrating large language models into frontier mathematical research, enabling faster exploration of proof space and algorithm design while maintaining transparent reasoning responsibilities. Although illustrated on manifold optimization problems in quantum computing, the principles extend to other core areas of scientific computing."}

In the aggregation stage, global and weighted strategies are combined to generate robust text-level vectors.

However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings."}

Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization. Across descriptors, the sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces the impact of aliased loops compared with single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines.

In particular, nominal frameworks are metalanguages that feature (among others) name abstraction types, which can be used to specify the type of binders. The resulting syntax representation (nominal data types) makes alpha-equivalent terms equal, and features a name-invariant induction principle. It is known that name abstraction types can be presented either as existential or universal quantification on names. On the one hand, nominal frameworks use the existential presentation for practical reasoning since the user is allowed to match on a name-term pattern where the name is bound in the term. However inference rules for existential name abstraction are cumbersome to specify/implement because they must keep track of information about free and bound names at the type level. On the other hand, universal name abstractions are easier to specify since they are treated not as pairs, but as functions consuming fresh names. Yet the ability to pattern match on such functions is seemingly lost. In this work we show that this ability and others are recovered in a type theory consisting of (1) nullary ($0$-ary) internally parametric type theory (nullary PTT) (2) a type of names and a novel name induction principle (3) nominal data types. This extension of nullary PTT can act as a legitimate nominal framework. Indeed it has universal name abstractions, nominal pattern matching, a freshness type former, name swapping and local-scope operations and (non primitive) existential name abstractions. We illustrate how term-relevant nullary parametricity is used to recover nominal pattern matching. Our main example involves synthetic Kripke parametricity."}

However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers."}

To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline.

Specifically, a visual-aware edge module non-invasively captures real-time physiological data from bedside monitors, reducing manual entry errors. To improve accessibility to fragmented data sources, a semantic interaction module, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), enables physicians to perform efficient and intuitive voice-based queries over structured patient data.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) represent a transformative paradigm toward fully automated and intelligent network management, providing the scalability and adaptability required for the complexity of sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the distributed architecture, high openness, and deep heterogeneity of 6G networks expand the attack surface and pose unprecedented security challenges. To address this, security automation aims to enable intelligent security management across dynamic and complex environments, serving as a key capability for securing 6G ZTNs. Despite its promise, implementing security automation in 6G ZTNs presents two primary challenges: 1) automating the lifecycle from security strategy generation to validation and update under real-world, parallel, and adversarial conditions, and 2) adapting security strategies to evolving threats and dynamic environments. This motivates us to propose SecLoop and SA-GRPO. SecLoop constitutes the first fully automated framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) across the entire lifecycle of security strategy generation, orchestration, response, and feedback, enabling intelligent and adaptive defenses in dynamic network environments, thus tackling the first challenge. Furthermore, we propose SA-GRPO, a novel security-aware group relative policy optimization algorithm that iteratively refines security strategies by contrasting group feedback collected from parallel SecLoop executions, thereby addressing the second challenge. Extensive real-world experiments on five benchmarks, including 11 MITRE ATT&CK processes and over 20 types of attacks, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SecLoop and SA-GRPO. We will release our platform to the community, facilitating the advancement of security automation towards next generation communications."}

While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \\model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \\model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \\model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning."}

To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency."}

To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics.

Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance.

We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions."}

They weakly assess regulatory compliance and investor-protection norms, rarely stress-test multi-turn adversarial tactics such as jailbreaks or prompt injection, inconsistently ground answers in long filings, ignore tool- or RAG-induced over-reach risks, and rely on opaque or non-auditable evaluation protocols. To close these gaps, we introduce CNFinBench, a benchmark that employs finance-tailored red-team dialogues and is structured around a Capability-Compliance-Safety triad, including evidence-grounded reasoning over long reports and jurisdiction-aware rule/tax compliance tasks. For systematic safety quantification, we introduce the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS) to measure how consistently models resist harmful prompts across multi-turn adversarial dialogues. To ensure auditability, CNFinBench enforces strict output formats with dynamic option perturbation for objective tasks and employs a hybrid LLM-ensemble plus human-calibrated judge for open-ended evaluations. Experiments on 21 models across 15 subtasks confirm a persistent capability-compliance gap: models achieve an average score of 61.0 on capability tasks but fall to 34.18 on compliance and risk-control evaluations.

Results show that CanAnswer improves the recalled gained knowledge and reduces the task workload of the learning session. Our expert interviews (N=6) further confirm the reliability and usefulness of CanAnswer. We discuss the generality of CanAnswer and provide design considerations for enhancing the usefulness and credibility of community-powered learning tools."}

To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.\n  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.\n  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.\n  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.\n  Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning. Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses."}

Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, multi-modal workloads that strain conventional query optimizers and caching mechanisms. We propose an Agent-Centric Data Fabric, a unified architecture that rethinks how data systems serve, optimize, coordinate, and learn from agentic workloads. To achieve this we exploit the concepts of attention-guided data retrieval, semantic micro-caching for context-driven agent federations, predictive data prefetching and quorum-based data serving. Together, these mechanisms enable agents to access representative data faster and more efficiently, while reducing redundant queries, data movement, and inference load across systems. By framing data systems as adaptive collaborators, instead of static executors, we outline new research directions toward behaviorally responsive data infrastructures, where caching, probing, and orchestration jointly enable efficient, context-rich data exchange among dynamic, reasoning-driven agents."}

However, their widespread deployment currently suffers from methodological fragmentation and a lack of systematic soundness. This study proposes two comprehensive methodological frameworks designed to guide the strategic and responsible application of LLMs in language sciences. The first method-selection framework defines and systematizes three distinct, complementary approaches, each linked to a specific research goal: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-use models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning of open-source models for confirmatory, theory-driven investigation and high-quality data generation; and (3) extraction of contextualized embeddings for further quantitative analysis and probing of model internal mechanisms. We detail the technical implementation and inherent trade-offs of each method, supported by empirical case studies. Based on the method-selection framework, the second systematic framework proposed provides constructed configurations that guide the practical implementation of multi-stage research pipelines based on these approaches. We then conducted a series of empirical experiments to validate our proposed framework, employing retrospective analysis, prospective application, and an expert evaluation survey. By enforcing the strategic alignment of research questions with the appropriate LLM methodology, the frameworks enable a critical paradigm shift in language science research. We believe that this system is fundamental for ensuring reproducibility, facilitating the critical evaluation of LLM mechanisms, and providing the structure necessary to move traditional linguistics from ad-hoc utility to verifiable, robust science."}

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline.

Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings. These results substantially outperform baseline methods including WOA, GA, PEWOA, and GCWOA underscoring PHWSOA's strong potential for enabling efficient resource management in practical cloud environments."}

This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments. https://yufengsjtu.github.io/MasterRacing.github.io/"}

However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks."}

We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level. This study contributes to the digital advancement of agriculture through the application of scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks that can be extended to related domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation, such as carbon markets."}

On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging."}

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure.

To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code."}

Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\\% of the original C3D required on the same device."}

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph."}

To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks.

First, we design a cluster-aware odometry network that incorporates object-level cues from the clustered radar points for inter-frame matching, alongside a hierarchical self-supervision mechanism to overcome outliers through spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, and feature contrast. Second, we propose using 3D gaussians as an intermediate representation, coupled with a radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization, to recover blurry map areas and those undetected based on image texture. Experiments show that Super4DR achieves a 67% performance gain over prior self-supervised methods, nearly matches supervised odometry, and narrows the map quality disparity with LiDAR while enabling multi-modal image rendering."}

However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice."}

To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories. Across 20 evaluated LLMs, Mindora achieves the highest average performance on MentraBench and shows remarkable performances in reasoning reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex mental-health scenarios."}

However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models."}

Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $κ$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks."}

Existing RL methods for dLLMs fall short in both aspects: they rely on coarse or unverifiable reward signals, and they estimate prediction probabilities without accounting for the bias relative to the true, unbiased expected prediction probability that properly integrates over all possible decoding orders. To mitigate these issues, we propose \\emph{d}-TreeRPO, a reliable RL framework for dLLMs that leverages tree-structured rollouts and bottom-up advantage computation based on verifiable outcome rewards to provide fine-grained and verifiable step-wise reward signals. When estimating the conditional transition probability from a parent node to a child node, we theoretically analyze the estimation error between the unbiased expected prediction probability and the estimate obtained via a single forward pass, and find that higher prediction confidence leads to lower estimation error. Guided by this analysis, we introduce a time-scheduled self-distillation loss during training that enhances prediction confidence in later training stages, thereby enabling more accurate probability estimation and improved convergence. Experiments show that \\emph{d}-TreeRPO outperforms existing baselines and achieves significant gains on multiple reasoning benchmarks, including +86.2 on Sudoku, +51.6 on Countdown, +4.5 on GSM8K, and +5.3 on Math500.

To fill this gap, we conducted comprehensive experiments and found that stragglers remain widespread due to CPU and bandwidth usage imbalances. Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs. Moreover, it proactively prevents stragglers by avoiding overloading the CPU and bandwidth resources in allocating PSs (which consume high CPU and bandwidth) and in gradient transmission. Our trace-driven evaluation on AWS shows that STAR generates 48-84% and 51-70% lower TTA than state-of-the-art systems in the PS and all-reduce architectures, respectively, while maintaining the converged accuracy of SSGD.

However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model. Additionally, we show that our approach is both orthogonal and complementary to existing unlearning methods, thereby highlighting its potential to improve current unlearning and de-memorization techniques."}

Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Recent frameworks such as SMART, incorporate kinodynamic modeling and offer the MAPF community a platform for large-scale, realistic evaluation. Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings. We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality. Empirically, we examine these factors to understand how these design choices affect performance in realistic scenarios.

But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data."}

We present MOA (Multi-Objective Alignment), a reinforcement-learning framework that enables multi-dimensional, fine-grained rubric optimization for general RPAs. MOA introduces a novel multi-objective optimization strategy that trains simultaneously on multiple fine-grained rubrics to boost optimization performance.

Our key insight is to constrain LLMs to generate normalized claim decompositions rather than complete proofs, significantly reducing syntax errors.

It is built upon Operational Differencing, a new technique for managing data in terms of high-level operations that include refactorings and schema changes. We use operational differencing to construct an operation-based form of version control on data structures used in programming languages and relational databases. This approach to data version control does fine-grained diffing and merging despite intervening structural transformations like schema changes. It offers users a simplified conceptual model of version control for ad hoc usage: There is no repo; Branching is just copying. The informaton maintained in a repo can be synthesized more precisely from the append-only histories of branches. Branches can be flexibly shared as is commonly done with document files, except with the added benefit of diffing and merging. We conjecture that queries can be operationalized into a sequence of schema and data operations. We develop that idea on a query language fragment containing selects and joins. Operationalized queries are represented as a future timeline that is speculatively executed as a branch off of the present state, returning a value from its hypothetical future. Operationalized queries get rewritten to accommodate schema change \"for free\" by the machinery of operational differencing. Altogether we develop solutions to four of the eight challenge problems of schema evolution identified in a recent paper."}

To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer program are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work applying LLMs to the design of advanced cost function of steganography, which presents a novel perspective for steganography design and may shed light on further research."}

Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States. Other low-cost models, GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, respond to the prompt language used (i.e., English or Simplified Chinese) and cultural prompting strategies to create acceptable alignments with both the United States and China."}

Created using style transfer techniques from 12 subject classification datasets, SMA provides a diverse and extensive set of 4800 groups, combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, human actions, textures) with multiple styles. SMA enables flexible control over groups and classes, allowing us to configure datasets to reflect diverse benchmark scenarios. While ideally, data collection would capture extensive group diversity, practical constraints often make this infeasible. SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \\textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity.

This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training.

To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset.

Field trials in Achocalla Lagoon (La Paz, Bolivia) demonstrated 87% waypoint accuracy, stable autonomous navigation, and accurate physicochemical measurements (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids) comparable to manually collected references. These results demonstrate that the platform enables reliable high-resolution sampling and autonomous mission execution, providing a scalable solution for aquatic monitoring in remote environments."}

In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints. Ariel-ML thus provides a useful basis for TinyML practitioners and resource-constrained embedded Rust developers."}

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision."}

This limits the detailed examination of textual counseling conversations. In response, we developed a comprehensive new coding scheme that differentiates between 38 types of counselor and 28 types of client utterances, and created a labeled dataset consisting of about 2.800 messages from counseling conversations. We fine-tuned several models on our dataset to demonstrate its applicability. The data and models are publicly available to researchers and practitioners.

This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing."}

We remove the two structural assumptions typically required by other approaches, namely that the polynomial attains its infimum and zero-dimensionality of the gradient ideal. Our approach combines a denominator-free stereographic transformation with a refined variant of the Hanzon--Jibetean perturbation scheme. The stereographic transformation preserves nonnegativity while making the polynomial coercive, with explicit bounds on the radius of positivity and on the nonzero critical values. Subsequently, we apply carefully constructed explicit perturbations that enforce zero-dimensionality of the gradient ideal without altering nonnegativity, allowing us to invoke recent algorithms to derive algebraic certificates or rational witness points. We present three algorithms implementing our framework and analyze their bit complexity in detail, which is single exponential with respect to the number of variables. A second contribution is a new explicit SOS perturbation scheme, which allows us to perturb any nonnegative polynomial in such a way that it can be written as a sum of squares (SOS). In contrast to Lasserre's classical SOS approximation, which guaranties density but currently does not provide an effective control over the perturbation size, we only derive concrete perturbation bounds ensuring that a nonnegative polynomial enters the SOS cone."}

ACORN provides a fully automated pipeline that loads and deploys Python ML models on network devices using an optimized deployment plan from an ILP planner.

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks."}

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity. Extensive experiments across single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks verify that our DynaIP outperforms existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in the field of PT2l generation."}

We then show that the converse is not true: we construct a language whose generating series is algebraic (thus holonomic), but which is inherently weakly-ambiguous as a Parikh automata language.

It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts.

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality.

These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively."}

Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks.

Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.\n  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees."}

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation."}

Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language. A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative. This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities. Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential. The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages."}

Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems."}

The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods."}

Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation."}

In response, the research community has proposed defenses based on randomized and (de)randomized smoothing. However, these techniques remain susceptible to attacks that insert large adversarial payloads. To address these limitations, we propose a novel defense mechanism designed to harden end-to-end malware detectors by leveraging masking at the byte level. This mechanism operates by generating multiple masked versions of the input file, independently classifying each version, and then applying a threshold-based voting mechanism to produce the final classification. Key to this defense is a deterministic masking strategy that systematically strides a mask across the entire input file. Unlike randomized smoothing defenses, which randomly mask or delete bytes, this structured approach ensures coverage of the file over successive versions. In the best-case scenario, this strategy fully occludes the adversarial payload, effectively neutralizing its influence on the model's decision. In the worst-case scenario, it partially occludes the adversarial payload, reducing its impact on the model's predictions. By occluding the adversarial payload in one or more masked versions, this defense ensures that some input versions remain representative of the file's original intent, allowing the voting mechanism to suppress the influence of the adversarial payload. Results achieved on the EMBER and BODMAS datasets demonstrate the suitability of our defense, outperforming randomized and (de)randomized smoothing defenses against adversarial examples generated with a wide range of functionality-preserving manipulations while maintaining high accuracy on clean examples."}

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds."}

Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot.

Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications."}

By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models. Empirical validation on Gymnasium environments demonstrates that our framework not only explains policy actions, but also effectively captures the evolution of policy logic during training - from erratic, unstable behavior to optimized, robust strategies - providing actionable insights into agent sensitivity and decision boundaries."}

We first demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts NMT models to new languages and domains with performance on par with full-parameter techniques, while utilizing only a fraction of the parameter space. Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT."}

By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries.

In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction."}

Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training.

However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models.

Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression. We further explore different reservoir topologies, including ring, Erdős-Rényi (ER), and scale-free (SF) networks, to evaluate their impact predictive performance. Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic Rössler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies.

Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise.

We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} < M_{\\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$.

Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift.

Motivated by these needs, we developed a framework for monitoring deployed AI systems grounded in the mandate to take specific actions when they fail to behave as intended. This framework, which is now actively used at Stanford Health Care, is organized around three complementary principles: system integrity, performance, and impact. System integrity monitoring focuses on maximizing system uptime, detecting runtime errors, and identifying when changes to the surrounding IT ecosystem have unintended effects. Performance monitoring focuses on maintaining accurate system behavior in the face of changing health care practices (and thus input data) over time. Impact monitoring assesses whether a deployed system continues to have value in the form of benefit to clinicians and patients. Drawing on examples of deployed AI systems at our academic medical center, we provide practical guidance for creating monitoring plans based on these principles that specify which metrics to measure, when those metrics should be reviewed, who is responsible for acting when metrics change, and what concrete follow-up actions should be taken-for both traditional and generative AI. We also discuss challenges to implementing this framework, including the effort and cost of monitoring for health systems with limited resources and the difficulty of incorporating data-driven monitoring practices into complex organizations where conflicting priorities and definitions of success often coexist.

Here, we develop an interpretable, physically motivated framework to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that in systems with a large ''energy gap'' - separating a small fraction of meaningful states from a vast space of unrealistic states - learning from sparse data causes models to systematically overestimate high-energy state probabilities, a bias that lowering the sampling temperature corrects. More generally, we characterize how the optimal sampling temperature depends on the interplay between data size and the system's underlying energy landscape.

By mapping an n x n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. This reveals a connection between magic square constraints and statistical structure: we prove that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We introduce a covariance energy functional -- the sum of squared covariances with row, column, and diagonal indicator variables -- and prove for n=3 (via exhaustive enumeration) that its zeros are precisely the magic squares. Large-scale sampling for n=4,5 (460+ million arrangements) provides strong numerical evidence that this characterization extends to larger orders. Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D_4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes."}

When this source term is penalized based on the Fisher-Rao metric, the resulting model is referred to as the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) setting, and allows for the comparison between any two positive measures without the need for equalized total mass. In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path. In the present paper, we propose a further generalization of this framework, which allows for constraints that apply not just to the density path but also to the momentum and source terms, and incorporates affine inequalities in addition to equality constraints. We prove, under suitable assumptions on the constraints, the well-posedness of the resulting class of convex variational problems. The paper is then primarily devoted to developing an effective numerical pipeline that tackles the corresponding constrained optimization problem based on finite difference discretizations and parallel proximal schemes. Our proposed framework encompasses standard balanced and unbalanced optimal transport, as well as a multitude of natural and practically relevant constraints, and we highlight its versatility via several synthetic and real data examples."}

Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."}

Using this property, we derive a multi-level algorithm based on collision event propagator and show, both analytically and through numerical experiments, that it reproduces the results of standard Monte Carlo methods. We further demonstrate that, in the context of coupled plasma-neutral edge simulations employing correlated Monte Carlo, the proposed scheme retains trajectory correlation to machine precision as the system evolves, whereas conventional methods exhibit rapid decorrelation.

However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models. While introduced for materials, our TNovD framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for other areas, such as images and molecules."}

Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself.

In this work, we focus on the inverse problem of identifying a spatially varying parameter in a constitutive model of three-dimensional elasticity, using measurements of the system's state. This setting is especially relevant for non-invasive diagnosis in cardiac biomechanics, where one must also carefully account for the type of boundary data available.

In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $Θ(1/\\varepsilon)$, matching the known $Ω(1/\\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$).

To appear at the 32nd IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2026)", "summary": "Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.\n  To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings.

Our main results establish a structural dichotomy for such classes: If $\\mathcal{G}$ is not an induced subgraph of $\\mathcal{P}_4$, then $\\mathsf{Free}(\\mathcal{G})$ is on top under effective bi-interpretability, implying that the members of $\\mathsf{Free}(\\mathcal{G})$ exhibit the full range of structural and computational behaviors. In contrast, if $\\mathcal{G}$ is an induced subgraph of $\\mathcal{P}_4$, then $\\mathsf{Free}(\\mathcal{G})$ is structurally simple, as witnessed by the fact that every member satisfies the computable embeddability condition. This dichotomy is mirrored in the finite setting when one considers combinatorial and complexity-theoretic properties. Specifically, it is known that $\\mathsf{Free}(\\mathcal{G})^{fin}$ is complete for graph isomorphism and not a well-quasi-order under embeddability whenever $\\mathcal{G}$ is not an induced subgraph of $\\mathcal{P}_4$, while in all other cases $\\mathsf{Free}(\\mathcal{G})^{fin}$ forms a well-quasi-order and the isomorphism problem for $\\mathsf{Free}(\\mathcal{G})^{fin}$ is solvable in polynomial time."}

It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided \"H\"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided \"H\"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut."}

Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs."}

Our improvement comes from a new nonlinear monogamy-of-entanglement bound on star graphs and a refined parameterization of a shallow quantum circuit from previous works. We also prove limitations showing that current methods cannot achieve substantially better approximation ratios, indicating that further progress will require fundamentally new techniques."}
