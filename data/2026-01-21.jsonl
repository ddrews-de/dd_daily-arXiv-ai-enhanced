One crucial diagnostic criterion is the identification of unusual pigment network (PN). However, distinguishing between regular (typical) and irregular (atypical) PN is challenging. This study aims to automate the PN detection process using a directional imaging algorithm and classify PN types using machine learning classifiers. The directional imaging algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), contrast enhancement, filtering, and noise reduction. Applied to the PH2 dataset, this algorithm achieved a 96% success rate, which increased to 100% after pixel intensity adjustments. We created a new dataset containing only PN images from these results. We then employed two classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bag of Features (BoF), to categorize PN into atypical and typical classes. Given the limited dataset of 200 images, a simple and effective CNN was designed, featuring two convolutional layers and two batch normalization layers. The proposed CNN achieved 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our CNN demonstrated superior performance. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed CNN model for effective PN classification, suggesting future research should focus on expanding datasets and incorporating additional dermatological features to further enhance melanoma diagnosis."}

Existing deep learning methods typically address these in the spatial domain with an undifferentiated optimization objective, making it difficult to disentangle overlapping artifacts and limiting correction effectiveness. In this work, we perform a Fourier-domain analysis and reveal that these degradations are spectrally separable: Poisson noise and photon scarcity cause high-frequency phase perturbations, while attenuation errors suppress low-frequency amplitude components. Leveraging this insight, we propose FourierPET, a Fourier-based unrolled reconstruction framework grounded in the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. It consists of three tailored modules: a spectral consistency module that enforces global frequency alignment to maintain data fidelity, an amplitude-phase correction module that decouples and compensates for high-frequency phase distortions and low-frequency amplitude suppression, and a dual adjustment module that accelerates convergence during iterative reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FourierPET achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, while offering enhanced interpretability through frequency-aware correction."}

While recent deep networks such as transformers and activation-free architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy, their efficiency is typically measured in FLOPs or parameters, which do not correlate with latency on embedded hardware. We propose a hardware-aware adaptation framework that restructures existing models through sensitivity-guided block substitution, surrogate distillation, and training-free multi-objective search driven by device profiling. Applied to the 36-block NAFNet baseline, the optimized variants achieve up to 55% reduction in GMACs compared to the recent transformer-based SOTA while maintaining competitive accuracy. Most importantly, on-device deployment yields a 1.25X latency improvement over the baseline. Experiments on motion deblurring (GoPro), defocus deblurring (DPDD), and auxiliary benchmarks (RealBlur-J/R, HIDE) demonstrate the generality of the approach, while comparisons with prior efficient baselines confirm its accuracy-efficiency trade-off. These results establish feedback-driven adaptation as a principled strategy for bridging the gap between algorithmic design and deployment-ready deblurring models."}

Stability plays a crucial role in understanding generalization, robustness, and replicability, and a variety of stability notions have been proposed in different learning settings. However, while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning -- and indeed, it may be at odds with accuracy, since an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Thus, it is essential to understand the potential statistical cost of stability. In this work, we address this question by adopting a statistical decision-theoretic perspective, treating stability as a constraint in estimation. Focusing on two representative notions-worst-case stability and average-case stability-we first establish general lower bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy under each type of stability constraint. We then develop optimal stable estimators for four canonical estimation problems, including several mean estimation and regression settings. Together, these results characterize the optimal trade-offs between stability and accuracy across these tasks. Our findings formalize the intuition that average-case stability imposes a qualitatively weaker restriction than worst-case stability, and they further reveal that the gap between these two can vary substantially across different estimation problems."}

Traditional registration methods often struggle to ensure accuracy due to the large intensity differences between diffusion data and high-resolution anatomical structures. This paper proposes an unsupervised registration framework based on a generative registration network, which transforms the original multimodal registration problem between b0 and T1w images into a unimodal registration task between a generated image and the real T1w image. This effectively reduces the complexity of cross-modal registration. The framework first employs an image synthesis model to generate images with T1w-like contrast, and then learns a deformation field from the generated image to the fixed T1w image. The registration network jointly optimizes local structural similarity and cross-modal statistical dependency to improve deformation estimation accuracy. Experiments conducted on two independent datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in multimodal registration tasks."}

Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival."}

The ME model inflates within-study variances by a common factor estimated via weighted least squares, yielding identical point estimates to a fixed-effect model while inflating confidence intervals. We empirically compared RE and ME models across NMAs of two-arm studies with significant heterogeneity from the nmadb database, assessing model fit using the Akaike Information Criterion. The ME model often provided comparable or better fit to the RE model. Case studies further revealed that RE models are sensitive to extreme and imprecise observations, whereas ME models assign less weight to such observations and hence exhibit greater robustness to publication bias. Our results suggest that the ME model warrant consideration alongside conventional RE model in NMA practice."}

To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Adversarial Drift-Aware Predictive Transfer (ADAPT), a novel framework designed to confer durability against temporal drift with minimal retraining. ADAPT innovatively constructs an uncertainty set of plausible future models by combining historical source models and limited current data. By optimizing worst-case performance over this set, it balances current accuracy with robustness against degradation due to future drifts. Crucially, ADAPT requires only summary-level model estimators from historical periods, preserving data privacy and ensuring operational simplicity. Validated on longitudinal suicide risk prediction using electronic health records from Mass General Brigham (2005--2021) and Duke University Health Systems, ADAPT demonstrated superior stability across coding transitions and pandemic-induced shifts.

In this work, a large-scale spectrum sensing network (LarS-Net) is designed in a cost-effective manner. Spectrum sensors are either co-located with base stations (BSs) to share the tower, backhaul, and power infrastructure, or integrated directly into BSs as a new feature leveraging active BS antenna systems. As an example incumbent system, fixed service microwave link operating in the lower-7 GHz band is investigated. This band is a primary candidate for 6G, being considered by the WRC-23, ITU, and FCC. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the minimum subset of BSs equipped with sensing capability to guarantee a target incumbent detection probability. The simulations account for various sensor antenna configurations, propagation channel models, and duty cycles for both incumbent transmissions and sensing operations. Building on this framework, we introduce three network-level sensing performance metrics: Emission Detection Probability (EDP), Temporal Detection Probability (TDP), and Temporal Mis-detection Probability (TMP), which jointly capture spatial coverage, temporal detectability, and multi-node diversity effects. Using these metrics, we analyze the impact of LarS-Net inter-site distance, noise uncertainty, and sensing duty-cycle on large-scale sensing performance."}

These shifts in climate patterns pose a direct threat to the insurance industry, which faces growing exposure to weather-related damages. As claims linked to extreme weather rise, insurance companies need reliable tools to assess future risks. This is not only essential for setting premiums and maintaining solvency but also for supporting broader disaster preparedness and resilience efforts. In this study, we propose a two-step method to examine the impact of precipitation on home insurance claims. Our approach combines the predictive power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of copula-based multivariate analysis, enabling a more detailed understanding of how precipitation patterns relate to claim dynamics.

In a non-stationary channel, the amplitudes and phases of arriving signals may vary significantly over time, making it infeasible to directly measure the influence of hardware. In this paper, we present a calibration method for achieving indirect measurement and compensation of hardware influences in non-stationary channels. Our method characterizes the patterns of array elements relative to a reference element and estimates these relative patterns, termed residual surfaces, using a Slepian spherical harmonic basis. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our calibration method achieves beamforming gains that closely match theoretical optimums.

Recent score-matching approaches to SIVI (SIVI-SM) address this issue via a minimax formulation, at the expense of an additional lower-level optimization problem. In this paper, we propose kernel semi-implicit variational inference (KSIVI), a principled and tractable alternative that eliminates the lower-level optimization by leveraging kernel methods. We show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the lower-level problem admits an explicit solution, reducing the objective to the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD). Exploiting the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit distributions, the resulting KSD objective can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. We establish optimization guarantees via variance bounds on Monte Carlo gradient estimators and derive statistical generalization bounds of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{n})$. We further introduce a multi-layer hierarchical extension that improves expressiveness while preserving tractability. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world Bayesian inference tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of KSIVI."}

In data applications, TVaR is often estimated using the empirical method, owing to its simplicity and nonparametric nature. The empirical TVaR has been explicitly advocated by regulatory authorities as a standard approach for computing TVaR. However, prior literature has pointed out that the empirical TVaR estimator is negatively biased, which can lead to a systemic underestimation of risk in finite-sample applications. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of the bias of the empirical TVaR estimator in two dimensions: its magnitude as well as the key distributional and structural determinants driving the severity of the bias. To this end, we derive a leading-term approximation for the bias based on its asymptotic expansion. The closed-form expression associated with the leading-term approximation enables us to obtain analytical insights into the structural properties governing the bias of the empirical TVaR estimator. To account for the discrepancy between the leading-term approximation and the true bias, we further derive an explicit upper bound for the bias. We validate the proposed bias analysis framework via simulations and demonstrate its practical relevance using real data."}

However, justifying the validity of the instrument often poses a significant challenge. In this work, we highlight a problem generally neglected in arguments for instrumental variable validity: the presence of an ''aggregate treatment variable'', where the treatment (e.g., education, GDP, caloric intake) is composed of finer-grained components that each may have a different effect on the outcome. We show that the causal effect of an aggregate treatment is generally ambiguous, as it depends on how interventions on the aggregate are instantiated at the component level, formalized through the aggregate-constrained component intervention distribution. We then characterize conditions on the interventional distribution and the aggregate setting under which standard instrumental variable estimators identify the aggregate effect. The contrived nature of these conditions implies major limitations on the interpretation of instrumental variable estimates based on aggregate treatments and highlights the need for a broader justificatory base for the exclusion restriction in such settings."}

While directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are widely used in etiological research to identify and illustrate bias structures, they have not been systematically applied to DTA studies. Methods: We developed DAGs to illustrate the causal structures underlying common biases in DTA studies. For each bias, we present the corresponding DAG structure and demonstrate the parallel with equivalent biases in etiological studies. We use real-world examples to illustrate each bias mechanism. Results: We demonstrate that five major biases in DTA studies can be represented using DAGs with clear structural parallels to etiological studies: reference standard error bias corresponds to exposure misclassification, misassumption of conditional independence creates spurious correlations similar to unmeasured confounding, spectrum effect parallels effect modification, confounding operates through backdoor paths in both settings, and partial verification bias mirrors selection bias. These DAG representations reveal the causal mechanisms underlying each bias and suggest appropriate correction strategies. Conclusions: DAGs provide a valuable framework for understanding bias structures in DTA studies and should complement existing quality assessment tools like STARD and QUADAS-2. We recommend incorporating DAGs during study design to prospectively identify potential biases and during reporting to enhance transparency. DAG construction requires interdisciplinary collaboration and sensitivity analyses under alternative causal structures."}

The core reason for their effectiveness lies in the fact that damage or structural state transition can be manifested as changes in the distribution of DSF data. This enables us to reframe the problem of damage detection as one of identifying these distributional changes. Hence, developing automated tools for detecting such changes is pivotal for automated structural health diagnosis. Control charts are extensively utilized in SHM for DSF change detection, owing to their excellent online detection and early warning capabilities. However, conventional methods are primarily designed to detect mean or variance shifts, making it challenging to identify complex shape changes in distributions. This limitation results in insufficient damage detection sensitivity. Moreover, they typically exhibit poor robustness against data contamination. This paper proposes a novel control chart to address these limitations. It employs the probability density functions (PDFs) of subgrouped DSF data as monitoring objects, with shape deformations characterized by warping functions. Furthermore, a nonparametric control chart is specifically constructed for warping function monitoring in the functional data analysis framework. Key advantages of the new method include the ability to detect both shifts and complex shape deformations in distributions, excellent online detection performance, and robustness against data contamination. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate its superiority over competing approaches. Finally, the method is applied to detecting distributional changes in DSF data for cable condition assessment in a long-span cable-stayed bridge, demonstrating its practical utility in engineering."}

Using object recognition, the system detects and localizes components in real time to create a digital twin of the workspace. For each assembly step, it overlays bounding boxes in AR to indicate both the current position and the target placement of relevant components, while hand-tracking data verifies whether the user interacts with the correct part. Rather than enforcing a fixed sequence, the system highlights potential assembly errors and interprets user deviations as opportunities for iteration and creative exploration. A case study with LEGO blocks and custom 3D-printed components demonstrates how the system links digital instructions to physical assembly, eliminating the need for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of parts."}

We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts."}

From 792 screened studies, seventeen high-quality papers were synthesized to identify core gamification mechanics, including avatars, XR affordances, and identity-driven engagement strategies. Building on these insights, we propose the Affordance-Driven Gamification Framework (ADGF), a conceptual model for designing socially immersive experiences, along with a five-step design process to support its real-world application.

The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches."}

Under review", "summary": "Surface ozone pollution remains a persistent challenge in many metropolitan regions worldwide, as the nonlinear dependence of ozone formation on nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) complicates the design of effective emission control strategies. While chemical transport models provide mechanistic insights, they rely on detailed emission inventories and are computationally expensive.\n  This study develops a machine learning--based surrogate framework inspired by the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA). Using hourly air quality observations from Los Angeles during 2024--2025, a random forest model is trained to predict surface ozone concentrations based on precursor measurements and spatiotemporal features, including site location and cyclic time encodings. The model achieves strong predictive performance, with permutation importance highlighting the dominant roles of diurnal temporal features and nitrogen dioxide, along with additional contributions from carbon monoxide.\n  Building on the trained surrogate, EKMA-style sensitivity experiments are conducted by perturbing precursor concentrations while holding other covariates fixed. The results indicate that ozone formation in Los Angeles during the study period is predominantly VOC-limited. Overall, the proposed framework offers an efficient and interpretable approach for ozone regime diagnosis in data-rich urban environments."}

However, in practice, the assumptions of parametric form for the uncure probability and the proportional hazards model for the susceptible may not always be satisfied. In this paper, we propose a class of flexible single-index semiparametric transformation cure models for interval-censored data, where a single-index model and a semiparametric transformation model are utilized for the uncured and conditional survival probability, respectively, encompassing both the proportional hazards cure and proportional odds cure models as specific cases. We approximate the single-index function and cumulative baseline hazard functions via the kernel technique and splines, respectively, and develop a computationally feasible expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, facilitated by a four-layer gamma-frailty Poisson data augmentation.

Previous work has demonstrated that real-time biofeedback targeting anterior ground reaction forces (AGRFs) can increase propulsion in individuals post-stroke, however this work was confined to lab-based treadmills, limiting practical utility. Here we investigate the short-term effects of real-time AGRF gait biofeedback during overground walking using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a haptic feedback device. Eight individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis completed four 3-minute training bouts. During training, faded haptic biofeedback was provided to increase paretic AGRF during terminal stance. Gait biomechanics were assessed before, during, and after training, and during a retention test conducted without biofeedback after a rest period. The primary dependent variable was peak paretic AGRF, while secondary variables included paretic peak trailing limb angle (TLA), step length and walking speed. Compared to baseline, peak AGRF increased post-feedback and at the retention tests. Similar trends were observed in TLA, and step length, although these increases were not statistically significant while speed showed a significant change from baseline. Examining individual participants 63% participants (responders) increased AGRF at retention, while 37% experienced decreases (non-responders). Non-responders had lower physical capability, evidenced by two-minute walk distance at screening and AFO use during training, suggesting this intervention may suit patients with more residual ankle mobility and strength. Nonetheless our results suggest AGRF biofeedback can be implemented in practical settings with wearable systems and is a promising gait training strategy to target propulsive deficits in individuals post stroke."}

Koopman-based MPC enables QP-based control of nonlinear systems by lifting the dynamics to a higher-dimensional linear representation. However, existing approaches rely on single-step EDMD. Consequently, prediction errors may accumulate over long horizons when the EDMD operator is applied recursively. Moreover, the multi-step prediction loss is nonconvex with respect to the single-step EDMD operator, making long-horizon model identification particularly challenging. This paper proposes a multi-step EDMD framework that directly learns the condensed multi-step state-control mapping required for Koopman-MPC, thereby bypassing explicit identification of the lifted system matrices and subsequent model condensation. The resulting identification problem admits a convex least-squares formulation. We further show that the problem decomposes across prediction horizons and state coordinates, enabling parallel computation and row-wise $\\ell_1$-regularization for automatic dictionary pruning. A non-asymptotic finite-sample analysis demonstrates that, unlike one-step EDMD, the proposed method avoids error compounding and yields error bounds that depend only on the target multi-step mapping. Numerical examples validate improved long-horizon prediction accuracy and closed-loop performance."}

In this paper, we propose semi- and non-parametric contaminated Gaussian mixture of regressions to robustly estimate the parametric and/or non-parametric terms of the models in the presence of mild outliers. The virtue of using a contaminated Gaussian error distribution is that we can simultaneously perform model-based clustering of observations and model-based outlier detection. We propose two algorithms, an expectation-maximization (EM)-type algorithm and an expectation-conditional-maximization (ECM)-type algorithm, to perform maximum likelihood and local-likelihood kernel estimation of the parametric and non-parametric of the proposed models, respectively.

Assistive technologies divide into two flawed categories: prohibitively expensive commercial gloves (often exceeding \\$3,000) or fragile research prototypes reliant on flex sensors that degrade rapidly under mechanical stress. This paper introduces a robust, cost-effective sign language recognition system tailored for the Nepali Sign Language (NSL) community. Departing from traditional resistive sensing, we implement a non-contact Hall-effect architecture that correlates magnetic field intensity with finger flexion, eliminating mechanical wear and signal drift. The system integrates 14 sensor nodes across the DIP, PIP, and MCP joints, augmented by an MPU6050 IMU for wrist orientation. An embedded Multi-Layer Perceptron, executed locally on an Arduino Mega, performs gesture classification, negating the need for cloud dependencies. With a Bill of Materials between \\$80 and \\$100, this solution is approximately 30 times more affordable than market alternatives. Validation trials across five subjects yielded 96\\% accuracy on a fundamental NSL vocabulary. Stress testing confirmed that the Hall-effect configuration maintains signal fidelity over repeated cycles where traditional sensors fail. This study demonstrates that high-precision recognition is achievable through strategic engineering rather than premium components, offering a scalable pathway for deployment in Nepal's deaf schools."}

As a result, most radar-based fall detectors are trained on staged falls from young volunteers, and representation choices are rarely tested against the radar signals from dangerous falls. This paper uses a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar digital twin as a single simulated room testbed to study how representation choice affects fall/non-fall discrimination. From the same simulated range-Doppler sequence, Doppler-time spectrograms, three-channel per-receiver spectrogram stacks, and time-pooled range-Doppler maps (RDMs) are derived and fed to an identical compact CNN under matched training on a balanced fall/non-fall dataset. In this twin, temporal spectrograms reach 98-99% test accuracy with similar precision and recall for both classes, while static RDMs reach 89.4% and show more variable training despite using the same backbone. A qualitative comparison between synthetic and measured fall spectrograms suggests that the twin captures gross Doppler-time structure, but amplitude histograms reveal differences in the distributions of amplitude values consistent with receiver processing not modeled in the twin. Because the twin omits noise and hardware impairments and is only qualitatively compared to a single measured example, these results provide representation-level guidance under controlled synthetic conditions rather than ready-to-use clinical performance in real settings."}

For two binary exposure variables and a binary outcome variable, researchers need to assess not only the likelihood that an observed outcome was caused by a particular exposure, but also the likelihood that it resulted from the interaction between the two exposures. For example, in the case of a male worker who smoked, was exposed to asbestos, and developed lung cancer, researchers aim to explore whether the cancer resulted from smoking, asbestos exposure, or their interaction. Even in randomized controlled trials, widely regarded as the gold standard for causal inference, identifying and evaluating retrospective causal interactions between two exposures remains challenging. In this paper, we define posterior probabilities to characterize the interactive causes of an observed outcome. We establish the identifiability of posterior probabilities by using a secondary outcome variable that may appear after the primary outcome. We apply the proposed method to the classic case of smoking and asbestos exposure. Our results indicate that for lung cancer patients who smoked and were exposed to asbestos, the disease is primarily attributable to the synergistic effect between smoking and asbestos exposure."}

In this article, we establish the asymptotic properties of the QTE estimator under rerandomization within a finite-population framework, without imposing any distributional or modeling assumptions on the covariates or outcomes.The estimator exhibits a non-Gaussian asymptotic distribution, represented as a linear combination of Gaussian and truncated Gaussian random variables. To facilitate inference, we propose a conservative variance estimator and construct corresponding confidence interval.

Building on this criterion within multi-sensor networks, we propose a robust distributed extended Kalman filter-AMKMMC-RDEKF based on adaptive multi-kernel mixture maximum correntropy. To reduce communication overhead, a consensus averaging strategy is incorporated. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is introduced to mitigate the impact of manually tuned free parameters. At the same time, the computational complexity and convergence ability of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through challenging scenarios involving power system and land vehicle state estimation."}

One of the most widely applied procedures worldwide is the so-called '1-In-6' test from the United Nations (UN) Manual of Tests in Criteria, which estimates a 'limiting stimulus' for a material. In this paper we demonstrate that, despite their popularity, limiting stimuli are not a well-defined notion of sensitivity and do not provide reliable information about a material's susceptibility to ignition. In particular, they do not permit construction of confidence intervals to quantify estimation uncertainty. We show that continued reliance on limiting stimuli through the 1-In-6 test has caused needless confusion in energetic materials research, both in theoretical studies and practical safety applications. To remedy this problem, we consider three well-founded alternative approaches to sensitivity testing to replace limiting stimulus estimation. We compare their performance in an extensive simulation study and apply the best-performing approach to real data, estimating the friction sensitivity of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)."}

Resisting screen-shooting attacks typically requires high-strength watermark embedding, inevitably degrading the cover image. To resolve the robustness-fidelity conflict, non-intrusive watermarking has emerged as a solution by constructing logical verification keys without altering the original content. However, existing non-intrusive schemes lack the capacity to withstand screen-shooting noise. While deep learning offers a potential remedy, we observe that directly applying it leads to a previously underexplored failure mode, the Structural Shortcut: networks tend to learn trivial identity mappings and neglect the image-watermark binding. Furthermore, even when logical binding is enforced, standard training strategies cannot fully bridge the noise gap, yielding suboptimal robustness against physical distortions. In this paper, we propose NiMark, an end-to-end framework addressing these challenges. First, to eliminate the structural shortcut, we introduce the Sigmoid-Gated XOR (SG-XOR) estimator to enable gradient propagation for the logical operation, effectively enforcing rigid image-watermark binding. Second, to overcome the robustness bottleneck, we devise a two-stage training strategy integrating a restorer to bridge the domain gap caused by screen-shooting noise. Experiments demonstrate that NiMark consistently outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods against both digital attacks and screen-shooting noise, while maintaining zero visual distortion."}

Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses. The methods used have the potential to increase the determinism of the system, while simultaneously not removing the dynamic conversational abilities granted by the usage of LLMs. However, a great deal of work remains ahead, and the development of this kind of system needs to involve continuous testing and a human-in-the-loop. It should also be evaluated outside of commonly used benchmarks for LLMs, as these do not adequately capture the complexities of this kind of conversational system."}

The dominant diagonal resonance is actively damped to enable closed-loop bandwidths beyond the first structural mode, while a parallel band-pass damping path is specifically tuned to a higher-order resonance that predominantly affects the cross-coupling channels. Experimental results demonstrate that this targeted band-pass damping substantially reduces cross-axis coupling and enhances disturbance rejection, without compromising tracking accuracy."}

However, accurately quantifying uncertainty requires a correctly specified model, and there is increasing awareness of the problems that model misspecification causes for variable selection. Current solutions to this problem either require a more complex model, detracting from the interpretability of the original variable selection task, or gain robustness by moving outside of rigorous Bayesian uncertainty quantification. This paper establishes the model quasi-posterior as a principled tool for variable selection. We prove that the model quasi-posterior shares many of the desirable properties of full Bayesian variable selection, but no longer necessitates a full likelihood specification. Instead, the quasi-posterior only requires the specification of mean and variance functions, and as a result, is robust to other aspects of the data. Laplace approximations are used to approximate the quasi-marginal likelihood when it is not available in closed form to provide computational tractability. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies that the quasi-posterior improves variable selection accuracy across a range of data-generating scenarios, including linear models with heavy-tailed errors and overdispersed count data. We further illustrate the practical relevance of the proposed approach through applications to real datasets from social science and genomics"}

Using provincial data for Italy from 1952 to 2023, we analyze two major cereals, maize and soft wheat, and quantify how abnormal weather conditions influence yields across the growing cycle. Unlike traditional statistical yield models, which assume additive temperature effects over the season, our approach is capable of capturing the timing and functional shape of weather impacts. In particular, the results show that above-average temperatures reduce maize yields primarily between June and August, while exerting a mild positive effect in April and October. For soft wheat, unusually high temperatures negatively affect yields from late March to early April. Precipitation also exerts season-dependent effects, improving wheat yields early in the season but reducing them later on. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for intra-seasonal weather patterns to provide insights for climate change adaptation strategies, including the timely adjustment of key crop management inputs."}

As relQuery services become more widely adopted in applications such as AI-powered spreadsheets, fast response times under concurrent query loads are increasingly important. Unfortunately, current LLM engines face severe latency bottlenecks from Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking across three comparable inference phases: waiting, core running, and tail running. Existing static priority scheduling methods only address HoL blocking during the waiting phase, leaving two critical problems unsolved. First, the absence of a priority update mechanism causes inaccurate prioritization and continued HoL blocking during core execution. Second, suboptimal prefill-decode batching exacerbates HoL blocking in tail execution and worsens latency trade-offs between running and waiting relQueries. To address these problems, we propose RelServe, an optimized LLM engine for low-latency relQuery serving. RelServe features two core innovations: a Dynamic Priority Updater that continuously adjusts priorities while minimizing overhead via statistical approximations, and an Adaptive Batch Arranger that quantitatively evaluates candidate prefill and decode batches to minimize projected average latency. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets using LLMs ranging from 13B to 70B parameters show that RelServe reduces average serving latency by up to 3.1x compared to vLLM."}

Initially, all clusters start in the control condition before crossing over to the intervention on a staggered schedule. In cohort designs, secular trends, cluster-level changes, and individual-level changes (e.g., aging) must be considered. Methods: We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the influence of different time effects on the estimation of the intervention effect in cohort SW-CRTs. We compared four linear mixed models with different adjustment strategies, all including random intercepts for clustering and repeated measurements. We recorded the estimated fixed intervention effects and their corresponding model-based standard errors, derived from models both without and with cluster-robust variance estimators (CRVEs). Results: Models incorporating fixed categorical time effects, a fixed intervention effect, and two random intercepts provided unbiased estimates of the intervention effect in both closed and open cohort SW-CRTs. Fixed categorical time effects captured temporal cohort changes, while random individual effects accounted for baseline differences. However, these differences can cause large, non-normally distributed random individual effects. CRVEs provide reliable standard errors for the intervention effect, controlling the Type I error rate. Conclusions: Our simulation study is the first to assess individual-level changes over time in cohort SW-CRTs. Linear mixed models incorporating fixed categorical time effects and random cluster and individual effects yield unbiased intervention effect estimates. However, cluster-robust variance estimation is necessary when time-varying independent variables exhibit nonlinear effects. We recommend always using CRVEs."}

We then apply a $k$-search algorithm to derive explicit charging (buying) and discharging (selling) thresholds with provable worst-case competitive ratio, and compute the corresponding action probabilities over the decision horizon. To compute exact distributions under operational limits, we develop a probability redistribution pruning method and use it to quantify the likelihood of meeting the terminal SoC band. Leveraging the resulting SoC distribution, we estimate the minimum stopping-time required to satisfy the SoC chance constraint. Computational experiments on historical real price data demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves the estimation of SoC evolution and supports chance-constraint satisfaction."}

The EWABG model works by integrating individual path-loss models into one single model in the least-squares sense, allowing to extend knowledge from frequencies and distances covered by path-loss datasets or path-loss propagation models. The proposed EWABG model is the first non-linear extension of the common ABG-based approach, which surpasses the non-uniformity problem between the low and high 5G frequencies (as most measurements campaigns have taken place in low frequencies). The EWABG also addresses the problem of removing outlier measurements, a step not included in previous propagation path-loss models. In this case, we have compared the most recent techniques for avoiding outliers, and we have adopted the Theil-Sen method, due to its strong robustness demonstrated in the experiments carried out. In addition, the proposed model specifically considers non-linear attenuation by atmospheric gases, in order to improve its estimations. The good performance of the proposed EWABG model has been tested and compared against recent 5G propagation path-loss models including the ABG and WABG models. The exhaustive experimentation carried out includes the 5G non-line-of-sight environment in different 5G scenarios, UMiSC, UMiOS and UMa.

The main purpose of the present work is to describe a generic strategy for designing a tight approximation to the full conformal prediction region that can be efficiently computed. Along with this approximate confidence region, a theoretical quantification of the tightness of this approximation is developed, depending on the smoothness assumptions on the loss and score functions.

As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech."}

Despite its conceptual appeal and long history, this framework becomes challenging to apply when the underlying design probabilities (i.e., propensity scores) are unknown, as is common in observational studies, real-world surveys, and missing-data settings. Existing plug-in or matching-based approaches either ignore the uncertainty stemming from estimated propensity scores or rely on the post-matching uniform-propensity condition (an assumption typically violated when there are multiple or continuous covariates), leading to systematic under-coverage. Finite-population M-estimation partially mitigates these issues but remains limited to parametric propensity score models.

The framework introduces a regeneration-and-union procedure that automatically propagates uncertainty in propensity score estimation into downstream design-based inference. It accommodates both parametric and nonparametric propensity score models, integrates seamlessly with standard tools in design-based inference with known propensity scores, and is universally applicable to various important design-based inference problems, such as observational studies, real-world surveys, and missing-data analyses, among many others. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed framework restores nominal coverage levels in settings where conventional methods suffer from severe under-coverage."}

However, due to the lengthy prompts and the resource constraints, mobile RAG systems exhibit significantly high response latency. On this issue, one promising approach is to reuse intermediate computational results across different queries to eliminate redundant computation. But most existing approaches, such as KV cache reuse and semantic cache reuse, are designed for cloud settings and perform poorly, overlooking the distinctive characteristics of mobile RAG.\n  We propose PerCache, a novel hierarchical cache solution designed for reducing end-to-end latency of personalized RAG applications on mobile platforms. PerCache adopts a hierarchical architecture that progressively matches similar queries and QKV cache to maximize the reuse of intermediate results at different computing stages. To improve cache hit rate, PerCache applies a predictive method to populate cache with queries that are likely to be raised in the future. In addition, PerCache can adapt its configurations to dynamic system loads, aiming at maximizing the caching utility with minimal resource consumption. We implement PerCache on top of an existing mobile LLM inference engine with commodity mobile phones. Extensive evaluations show that PerCache can surpass the best-performing baseline by 34.4% latency reduction across various applications and maintain optimal latency performance under dynamic resource changes."}

While the first approach objectively evaluates a singer's performance through computational metrics ranging from real-time visual feedback and acoustical biofeedback to sophisticated pitch tracking and spectral analysis, the latter method compares a predictor vocal signal with a target reference to capture nuanced data embedded in the singing voice. Notable advancements include the development of interactive systems that have significantly improved real-time visual feedback, and the integration of machine learning and deep neural network architectures that enhance the precision of vocal signal processing. This survey critically examines the literature to map the historical evolution of these technologies, while identifying and discussing key gaps. The analysis reveals persistent challenges, such as the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks, difficulties in reliably separating vocal signals from various noise sources, and the underutilization of advanced digital signal processing and artificial intelligence methodologies for capturing artistic expressivity. By detailing these limitations and the corresponding technological advances, this review demonstrates how addressing these issues can bridge the gap between objective computational assessments and subjective human-like evaluations of singing performance, ultimately enhancing both the technical accuracy and pedagogical relevance of automated singing evaluation systems."}

The proposed approach extends applicability to a broader class of $f$-divergences than previously reported and yields theoretical results that recover previously known results. Additionally, the difference between the expected empirical risk of the ERM-$f$DR solution and that of its reference measure is characterized, providing insights into previously studied cases of $f$-divergences. A central contribution is the introduction of the normalization function, a mathematical object that is critical in both the dual formulation and practical computation of the ERM-$f$DR solution. This work presents an implicit characterization of the normalization function as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), establishes its key properties, and subsequently leverages them to construct a numerical algorithm for approximating the normalization factor under mild assumptions. Further analysis demonstrates structural equivalences between ERM-$f$DR problems with different $f$-divergences via transformations of the empirical risk. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to compute the training and test risks of ERM-$f$DR solutions under different $f$-divergence regularizers.

Methods to compensate for turbulence typically rely on realistic turbulence data, which can be generated by i) experiment, ii) high-fidelity CFD, iii) low-fidelity CFD, and iv) autoregressive methods. However, each of these methods has significant drawbacks, including monetary and/or computational expense, limited quantity, inaccurate statistics, and overall complexity. In contrast, the boiling flow algorithm is a simple, computationally efficient model that can generate atmospheric phase screen data with only a handful of parameters. However, boiling flow has not been widely used in aero-optic applications, at least in part because some of these parameters, such as r0, are not clearly defined for aero-optic data. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to use the boiling flow algorithm to generate arbitrary length synthetic data to match the statistics of measured aero-optic data. Importantly, we modify the standard boiling flow method to generate anisotropic phase screens. While this model does not fully capture all statistics, it can be used to generate data that matches the temporal power spectrum or the anisotropic 2D structure function, with the ability to trade fidelity to one for fidelity to the other."}

We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism. Unlike conventional ANN systems, this approach enables exhaustive search over compact binary representations, allowing deterministic retrieval and eliminating accuracy degradation under high query concurrency. Using the MAIR benchmark across 14 datasets and 10,038 queries, we compare this architecture against Elasticsearch, Pinecone, PGVector, and Qdrant. Results demonstrate retrieval quality comparable to full-precision systems, while achieving substantially lower latency and maintaining constant throughput at high request rates.

The system was trained on a large, multi-center dataset comprising a primary cohort from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (9,189 cases, 594,099 images) and externally validated on cohorts from Stanford University (108 cases, 3,240 images) and a major Chinese medical center (257 cases, 3,178 images).

The model achieved high diagnostic accuracy across all tasks, generated reports that were indistinguishable from expert-written versions in blinded evaluations, and demonstrated superior factual accuracy and information density on content-based metrics.

Four predictor variables were examined: absolute difference from the aggregate, forecast value, days prior to question close, and mean standardized Brier score. Results indicated the recalibrated aggregate achieved the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.985), followed by both types of BNs, then the logistic regression models.

This is a preprint and has not been peer reviewed", "summary": "This paper addresses a long-standing gap in natural hazard modeling by unifying physics-based fragility functions with real-time post-disaster observations. It introduces a Bayesian framework that continuously refines regional vulnerability estimates as new data emerges. The framework reformulates physics-informed fragility estimates into a Probit-Normal (PN) representation that captures aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty in an analytically tractable form. Stage 1 performs local Bayesian updating by moment-matching PN marginals to Beta surrogates that preserve their probability shapes, enabling conjugate Beta-Bernoulli updates with soft, multi-fidelity observations. Fidelity weights encode source reliability, and the resulting Beta posteriors are re-projected into PN form, producing heteroscedastic fragility estimates whose variances reflect data quality and coverage. Stage 2 assimilates these heteroscedastic observations within a probit-warped Gaussian Process (GP), which propagates information from high-fidelity sites to low-fidelity and unobserved regions through a composite kernel that links space, archetypes, and correlated damage states. The framework is applied to the 2011 Joplin tornado, where wind-field priors and computer-vision damage assessments are fused under varying assumptions about tornado width, sampling strategy, and observation completeness. Results show that the method corrects biased priors, propagates information spatially, and produces uncertainty-aware exceedance probabilities that support real-time situational awareness."}

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

Since the distribution system (DS) does not cope with the high overloading capacity, the negative impact of EV charging load on the distribution network (DN) cannot be neglected. A high level of EV penetration with uncoordinated charging is the primary cause of voltage instability, increased peak load demand, and reliability issues of the DN.

By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy.

Here, we develop Bayesian Analysis with gene-Sets Informed Latent space (BASIL), a scalable Bayesian factor modeling framework that incorporates gene pathway annotations into latent variable analysis for RNA-sequencing data. BASIL places structured priors on factor loadings, shrinking them toward combinations of annotated gene sets, enhancing biological interpretability and stability, while simultaneously learning new unstructured components. BASIL provides accurate covariance estimates and uncertainty quantification, without resorting to computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. An automatic empirical Bayes procedure eliminates the need for manual hyperparameter tuning, promoting reproducibility and usability in practice.

This study proposes the Socio-Institutional Asynchrony Model, or SIAM, to quantitatively evaluate the relative effectiveness of two policy levers: intervention timing and enforcement efficiency. Using the timeline of the EU AI Act and an assumed compute doubling time of six months, we conduct a high precision simulation with 10001 time steps. The results show that an earlier intervention timing reduces the cumulative social burden by approximately sixty four percent, whereas improving enforcement efficiency reduces it by only about thirty percent. We further demonstrate analytically that advancing the start of intervention has structurally higher sensitivity, with roughly twice the relative effectiveness, compared to accelerating enforcement speed. These findings suggest that the core value of AI governance lies in proactive timeliness rather than reactive administrative efficiency."}

However, the learning-based lossless attribute compression of point clouds with varying densities is under-explored. In this paper, we develop a learning-based framework, namely DALD-PCAC that leverages Levels of Detail (LoD) to tailor for point cloud lossless attribute compression. We develop a point-wise attention model using a permutation-invariant Transformer to tackle the challenges of sparsity and irregularity of point clouds during context modeling. We also propose a Density-Adaptive Learning Descriptor (DALD) capable of capturing structure and correlations among points across a large range of neighbors. In addition, we develop a prior-guided block partitioning to reduce the attribute variance within blocks and enhance the performance. Experiments on LiDAR and object point clouds show that DALD-PCAC achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most data. Our method boosts the compression performance and is robust to the varying densities of point clouds. Moreover, it guarantees a good trade-off between performance and complexity, exhibiting great potential in real-world applications.

When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions. Finally, the practical effect of regularization is also demonstrated via simulation experiments."}

This study introduces the Signal Competition Mechanism, a unified framework validated by assessing behavioral correlations across 15 LLMs and performing latent-space probing on three representative open-source models. The analysis demonstrates that sycophancy and conformity originate from a convergent geometric manifold, hereafter termed the compliance subspace, which is characterized by high directional similarity in internal representations. Furthermore, the transition to compliance is shown to be a deterministic process governed by a linear boundary, where the Social Emotional Signal effectively suppresses the Information Calibration Signal. Crucially, we identify a \"Transparency-Truth Gap,\" revealing that while internal confidence provides an inertial barrier, it remains permeable and insufficient to guarantee immunity against intense social pressure. By formalizing the Integrated Epistemic Alignment Framework, this research provides a blueprint for transitioning from instructional adherence to robust epistemic integrity."}

Given the challenges and high costs associated with UWSN deployments, Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based localization offers a viable solution due to its minimal hardware requirements and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we assign distance-based weights to RSS measurements, providing higher reliability to closer anchor nodes. Using the weighted RSS measurements and generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), we propose the GTRS-based localization technique with Unknown Transmit Power (GUTP), which can be solved by a simple bisection method. Unlike conventional localization methods that require prior knowledge of the target node's transmit power, GUTP jointly estimates both the location and transmit power of the target node, broadening its practical use. Additionally, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for RSS-based underwater localization with known and unknown transmit power, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that GUTP achieves enhanced accuracy and significantly lower computational complexity in estimating the target node's location and transmit power compared to existing semidefinite programming (SDP)-based techniques."}

These groups are often defined by non-manipulable characteristics, e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, or English-language learner (ELL) status. While DIF can be framed as a causal fairness problem by treating group membership as the treatment variable, this invokes the long-standing controversy over the interpretation of causal effects for non-manipulable treatments. To better identify and interpret causal sources of DIF, this study leverages an interventionist approach using treatment decomposition proposed by Robins and Richardson (2010). Under this framework, we can decompose a non-manipulable treatment into intervening variables. For example, ELL status can be decomposed into English vocabulary unfamiliarity and classroom learning barriers, each of which influences the outcome through different causal pathways. We formally define separable DIF effects associated with these decomposed components, depending on the absence or presence of item impact, and provide causal identification strategies for each effect. We then apply the framework to biased test items in the SAT and Regents exams. We also provide formal detection methods using causal machine learning methods, namely causal forests and Bayesian additive regression trees, and demonstrate their performance through a simulation study. Finally, we discuss the implications of adopting interventionist approaches in educational testing practices."}

In this paper, a novel antenna structure is proposed to enable air-ground beam steering, facilitating simultaneous full-space sensing and communication (S&C). Specifically, instead of inserting a reflector behind the antenna array for backlobe mitigation, an omni-steering plate is introduced to collaborate with the active array for omnidirectional beamforming. Building on this hardware innovation, sum S&C mutual information (MI) is maximized, jointly optimizing user scheduling, passive coefficients of the omni-steering plate, and beamforming of the active array. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: one for optimizing passive coefficients via Riemannian gradient on the manifold, and the other for optimizing user scheduling and active array beamforming. Exploiting relationships among S&C MI, data decoding MMSE, and parameter estimation MMSE, the original subproblem is equivalently transformed into a sum weighted MMSE problem, rigorously established via the Lagrangian and first-order optimality conditions. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in sum-MI and MSE, while providing 360 sensing coverage.

Compass-Embedding v4 addresses three core challenges. First, large-batch contrastive training under mixed task supervision introduces systematic false negatives that degrade semantic alignment. We propose Class-Aware Masking (CAM), a lightweight modification to the InfoNCE objective that suppresses invalid in-batch negatives and improves semantic discrimination without altering training efficiency. Second, low-resource SEA languages suffer from limited and uneven data coverage. We construct a diversified training corpus through context-grounded synthetic data generation, cross-lingual translation, and structured e-commerce data construction, enabling robust multilingual and domain-specific learning. Third, production deployment requires high-throughput inference while preserving embedding quality. We combine robustness-driven large-batch training with spherical model merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and optimize inference via vLLM and FP8 quantization. Extensive evaluations across multilingual benchmarks and proprietary e-commerce tasks show that Compass-Embedding v4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major SEA languages, significantly outperforming general-purpose embedding models in domain-specific retrieval and classification, while maintaining competitive performance on high-resource languages."}

Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution.

The results show that high consistency across the model response is not an indicator of correctness, although HuatuoGPT-o1-8B showed the highest consistency rate. When tasked with selecting correct reasoning, both HuatuoGPT-o1-8B and Diabetica-o1 exhibit self-assessment bias and dependency on the order of the candidate explanations. Expert review of incorrect reasoning rationales identified a mix of clinically acceptable responses and clinical oversight.

We iteratively enrich the training set by actively learning points of largest approximation error through global optimization. The resulting models admit certified worst-case error bounds, either constant or input-dependent, over the entire input domain.

When the objective is to estimate the causal effect of a potentially endogenous treatment, a common approach -- which we call the canonical two-stage least squares (2sls) -- is to fit a 2sls regression of the outcome on treatment status with instrumental variables (IVs) for point estimation, and apply cluster-robust standard errors to account for clustering in inference. When both the treatment and IVs vary within clusters, a natural alternative -- which we call the two-stage least squares with fixed effects (2sfe) -- is to include cluster indicators in the 2sls specification, thereby incorporating cluster information in point estimation as well. This paper clarifies the trade-off between these two approaches within the local average treatment effect (LATE) framework, and makes three contributions. First, we establish the validity of both approaches for Wald-type inference of the LATE when clusters are homogeneous, and characterize their relative efficiency. We show that, when the true outcome model includes cluster-specific effects, 2sfe is more efficient than the canonical 2sls only when the variation in cluster-specific effects dominates that in unit-level errors. Second, we show that with heterogeneous clusters, 2sfe recovers a weighted average of cluster-specific LATEs, whereas the canonical 2sls generally does not. Third, to guide empirical choice between the two procedures, we develop a joint asymptotic theory for the two estimators under homogeneous clusters, and propose a Wald-type test for detecting cluster heterogeneity."}

Agre by situating his work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy, and critical theory. It reconstructs Agre's proposal of a critical technical practice, according to which AI should be understood not merely as an engineering discipline but as a form of mathematized philosophy shaped by historically contingent metaphors, assumptions, and discourses. Drawing on Heideggerian phenomenology, especially the distinction between ready-to-hand and present-at-hand, Agre sought to reform AI by emphasizing interaction, embedding, indexicality, and deictic representation over traditional mentalist and representational models. The paper analyzes Agre's attempt to operationalize these ideas through computational implementations such as the Pengi system, highlighting both the philosophical ambition and the technical limitations of programming phenomenological concepts. While acknowledging Agre's success in exposing the hidden philosophical commitments of AI and enriching its conceptual vocabulary, the paper ultimately argues that his project encounters a fundamental impasse: the open and self-disclosing character of human existence articulated by Heidegger cannot be fully captured or programmed without reducing ontological phenomena to ontic mechanisms. Agre's enduring contribution therefore lies less in offering a viable Heideggerian AI than in compelling technical practice to become reflexive, historically conscious, and openly philosophical."}

We combine these insights to show that -- when the noise is chosen carefully -- there is asymptotic independence between the model selected using a noisy penalized M-estimator, and the event that a standard (non-selective) confidence interval on noisy data covers the selected parameter.

Other analyses, including the new model updating formula and the analysis of the transformation's impact to model functions are presented. We propose two differentially private noise-adding mechanisms for privacy-preserving black-box optimization. Numerical results show that DFOp performs better than compared algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, DFOp is the first derivative-free solver that can solve black-box optimization problems with step-encryption and privacy-preserving black-box problems exactly, which also tries to answer the open question about the combination of derivative-free optimization and privacy."}

Personal use of this material is permitted", "summary": "This paper studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced decoupled symbiotic radio (SR) system in which a primary transmitter delivers common data to multiple primary receivers (PRs), while a RIS-based backscatter device sends secondary data to a backscatter receiver (BRx). Unlike conventional SR, the BRx performs energy detection and never decodes the primary signal, thereby removing ambiguity and preventing exposure of the primary payload to unintended receivers. In this paper, we formulate the problem as the minimization of the transmit power subject to a common broadcast rate constraint across all PRs and a bit error rate (BER) constraint at the BRx. The problem is nonconvex due to the unit-modulus RIS constraint and coupled quadratic forms. Leveraging a rate-balanced reformulation and a monotonic BER ratio characterization, we develop a low-complexity penalty-based block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates. Numerical results show fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and reduced power consumption of the considered RIS-enhanced information-decoupled SR system over conventional SR baselines."}

Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable. Results are consistent across multiple data splits and random seeds, demonstrating robustness."}

Unlike randomized trials, observational studies must adjust for systematic differences in patient characteristics between treatment groups. Propensity score methods, including matching, weighting, stratification, and regression adjustment, address this issue by creating groups that are comparable with respect to measured covariates. Among these approaches, overlap weighting (OW) has emerged as a principled and efficient method that emphasizes individuals at empirical equipoise, those who could plausibly receive either treatment. By assigning weights proportional to the probability of receiving the opposite treatment, OW targets the Average Treatment Effect in the Overlap population (ATO), achieves exact mean covariate balance under logistic propensity score models, and minimizes asymptotic variance. Over the last decade, the OW method has been recognized as a valuable confounding adjustment tool across the statistical, epidemiologic, and clinical research communities, and is increasingly applied in clinical and health studies. Given the growing interest in using observational data to emulate randomized trials and the capacity of OW to prioritize populations at clinical equipoise while achieving covariate balance (fundamental attributes of randomized studies), this article provides a concise overview of recent methodological developments in OW and practical guidance on when it represents a suitable choice for causal inference."}

We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism.

Nevertheless, high-noise audio inputs are prone to introducing adverse interference into the feature fusion process. To mitigate this, recent AVSR methods often adopt mask-based strategies to filter audio noise during feature interaction and fusion, yet such methods risk discarding semantically relevant information alongside noise. In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions."}

Evidence from Statistical Publications", "categories": ["stat.AP"], "comment": null, "summary": "Predicting highly-cited papers is a long-standing challenge due to the complex interactions of research content, scholarly communities, and temporal dynamics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) raise the question of whether early-stage textual information can provide useful signals of long-term scientific impact. Focusing on statistical publications, we propose a flexible, text-centered framework that leverages LLMs and structured prompt design to predict highly cited papers. Specifically, we utilize information available at the time of publication, including titles, abstracts, keywords, and limited bibliographic metadata. Using a large corpus of statistical papers, we evaluate predictive performance across multiple publication periods and alternative definitions of highly cited papers. The proposed approach achieves stable and competitive performance relative to existing methods and demonstrates strong generalization over time. Textual analysis further reveals that papers predicted as highly cited concentrate on recurring topics such as causal inference and deep learning. To facilitate practical use of the proposed approach, we further develop a WeChat mini program, \\textit{Stat Highly Cited Papers}, which provides an accessible interface for early-stage citation impact assessment. Overall, our results provide empirical evidence that LLMs can capture meaningful early signals of long-term citation impact, while also highlighting their limitations as tools for research impact assessment."}

Although additive noise can be correlated in practical scenarios, e.g., due to jamming, clutter, or other external disturbances, the effect of such correlation on the MMSE channel estimator in this setting remains unexplored in prior work. Against this backdrop, we derive a novel analytical expression for the general MIMO MMSE channel estimator, which is inherently nonlinear in one-bit observations, and accommodates arbitrary channel and noise correlation structures. To further characterize the impact of noise correlation, we subsequently specialize the general MMSE expression to certain tractable multi antenna configurations in which both the channel and the noise assume single-parameter constant correlation structures. Our analyses reveal nontrivial, noise-correlation-induced scenarios in which the estimator remains linear despite non-zero channel and noise correlation parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that, at low-to-medium signal-to-noise ratio, noise correlation improves the MMSE performance when channels are uncorrelated, but degrades performance when channels are strongly correlated."}

In a public health context, group testing aims to determine the health status values of p subjects from n<<p pooled tests, where a pool is defined as a mixture of small, equal-volume portions of the samples of a subset of subjects. This approach saves on the number of tests administered in pandemics or other resource-constrained scenarios. In practical group testing in time-constrained situations, a technician can inadvertently make a small number of errors during pool preparation, which leads to errors in the pooling matrix, which we term `model mismatch errors' (MMEs). This poses difficulties while determining health status values of the participating subjects from the results on n<<p pooled tests. In this paper, we present an algorithm to correct the MMEs in the pooled tests directly from the pooled results and the available (inaccurate) pooling matrix. Our approach then reconstructs the signal vector from the corrected pooling matrix, in order to determine the health status of the subjects. We further provide theoretical guarantees for the correction of the MMEs and the reconstruction error from the corrected pooling matrix. We also provide several supporting numerical results."}

We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO. Critically, GRADE-STE exhibits gradient variance over 14 times lower than REINFORCE and maintains stable training dynamics throughout optimization. Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested. GRADE offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to reinforcement learning for LLM alignment."}

To overcome this challenge, we propose decomposing each long separation filter into a bilinear form of two shorter filters, thereby reducing the number of parameters. Because the two filters are closely coupled, we design an alternating iterative projection algorithm to update them in turn. Simulation results show that, with far fewer parameters, the proposed method achieves improved performance and robustness."}

Evaluating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in this context presents new challenges, as the limitations of conventional approaches become more apparent. Questionnaires remain interrupted, while the utility of non-interrupted metrics like clickstream data is diminishing as more learning activity occurs within the dialogue. This study therefore investigates whether the student-AI dialogue can serve as a valid, non-interrupted data source for SRL assessment. We analyzed 421 dialogue logs from 98 university students interacting with a generative AI (GenAI) learning partner. Using large language model embeddings and clustering, we identified 22 dialogue patterns and quantified each student's interaction as a profile of alignment scores, which were analyzed against their Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ) scores. Findings revealed a significant positive association between proactive dialogue patterns (e.g., post-class knowledge integration) and overall SRL. Conversely, reactive patterns (e.g., foundational pre-class questions) were significantly and negatively associated with overall SRL and its sub-processes. A group comparison substantiated these results, with low-SRL students showing significantly higher alignment with reactive patterns than their high-SRL counterparts. This study proposed the Dialogue-Based Human-AI Self-Regulated Learning (DHASRL) framework, a practical methodology for embedding SRL assessment directly within the HAICL dialogue to enable real-time monitoring and scaffolding of student regulation."}

Balancing them to maximize system efficiency remains a central challenge in scalable AI design. To address this challenge, we introduce {Computation-Bandwidth-Memory Trade-offs}, termed the {AI Trinity}, a unified paradigm that positions {computation}, {bandwidth}, and {memory} as coequal pillars for next-generation AI infrastructure. AI Trinity enables dynamic allocation of resources across these pillars, alleviating single-resource bottlenecks and adapting to diverse scenarios to optimize system performance. Within this framework, AI Trinity identifies three fundamental trade-offs: (1) {More Computation$\\rightarrow$Less Bandwidth}, wherein computational resources are exploited to reduce data transmission under limited bandwidth conditions, (2) {More Bandwidth$\\rightarrow$Less Memory}, which exploits abundant communication capacity to populate or refresh memory when local storage resources are constrained, and (3) {More Memory$\\rightarrow$Less Computation}, whereby storage capacity are utilized to mitigate redundant computation when computational costs are prohibitive. We illustrate the effectiveness of AI Trinity through representative system designs spanning edge-cloud communication, large-scale distributed training, and model inference.

A collaborative robot executes geometry-calibrated, collision-aware hemispherical trajectories while carrying a calibrated receive probe, enabling controlled and repeatable spatial positioning around a fixed device under test. A spectrum-analyzer-based receiver chain acquires amplitude-only received power as a function of angle and distance following quasi-static pose stabilization. The proposed framework enables repeatable angular received-power mapping and power-domain comparison against idealized free-space references derived from full-wave simulation. Experimental results for a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate a mean absolute received-power error below 2 dB relative to simulation-derived references and a 36.5 % reduction in error compared to manual probe-station measurements, attributed primarily to reduced alignment variability and consistent spatial sampling. The proposed method eliminates the need for coherent field measurements and near-field transformations, enabling practical power-domain characterization of embedded mmWave modules. It is well suited for angular validation in real-world platforms where conventional anechoic measurements are impractical."}

To address these challenges within an oncology Clinical Trial Unit, we developed grstat, an R package providing a standardised set of tools for routine statistical analyses. Beyond the software itself, the development of grstat is embedded in a structured organisational framework combining formal request tracking, peer-reviewed development, automated testing, and staged validation of new functionalities. The package is intentionally opinionated, reflecting shared practices agreed upon within the unit, and evolves through iterative use in real-world projects. Its development as an open-source project on GitHub supports transparent workflows, collective code ownership, and traceable decision-making.  While primarily designed for internal use, this work illustrates a transferable approach to organising, validating, and maintaining a shared analytical toolbox in an academic setting. By coupling technical implementation with governance and validation principles, grstat supports efficiency, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability of biostatistical workflows, and may serve as a source of inspiration for other Clinical Trial Units facing similar organisational challenges."}

However, zero-shot large language models (LLMs) approach often produce superficial or general limitation statements (e.g., dataset bias or generalizability). They usually repeat limitations reported by authors without looking at deeper methodological issues and contextual gaps. This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance. The RAG + multi-agent GPT-4o mini configuration achieves a +15.51% coverage gain over zero-shot baselines, while the Llama 3 8B multi-agent setup yields a +4.41% improvement."}

Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features. To address these challenges, we introduce Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP), which scales language-audio pretraining to 109 million audio-text pairs with variable audio durations and incorporates multiple training objectives. SLAP unifies contrastive loss with additional self-supervised and captioning losses in a single-stage training, facilitating the learning of richer dense audio representations.

Despite this similarity, the deterministic assumptions underlying MLS fail to hold under random sampling. We begin by quantifying the probabilistic behavior of the fill-distance $h_n$ and \\textit{separation} $δ_n$ of an i.i.d. random sample. That is, for a distribution satisfying a mild regularity condition, $h_n\\propto n^{-1/d}\\log^{1/d} (n)$ and $δ_n \\propto n^{-1/d}$.

Additionally, We show that the MLS approximant is smooth with high probability. Finally, we apply the stochastic MLS theory to manifold estimation. Assuming that the sampled Manifold is $k$-times smooth, we show that the Hausdorff distance between the true manifold and its MLS reconstruction decays as $h_n^k$, extending the deterministic Manifold-MLS guarantees to random samples. This work provides the first unified stochastic analysis of MLS, demonstrating that -- despite the failure of deterministic sampling assumptions -- the classical convergence and smoothness properties persist under natural probabilistic models"}

This framework efficiently distributes the required corrective effort without revealing individual agents' private preferences. Our framework integrates high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), which enforce safety constraints with formal guarantees of safety for complex dynamical systems, with a privacy-preserving resource allocation mechanism based on the progressive second price (PSP) auction. When a joint safety constraint is violated, agents iteratively bid on new corrective efforts via 'avoidance credits' rather than explicitly solving for feasible corrective efforts that remove the safety violation. The resulting correction, determined via a second price payment rule, coincides with the socially optimal safe distribution of corrective actions. Critically, the bidding process achieves this optimal allocation efficiently and without revealing private preferences of individual agents. We demonstrate this method through multi-robot hardware experiments on the Robotarium platform."}

This trial will be carried out in four Subsaharan African countries from spring 2025. Since the safety of the highest dose is not yet established, the study begins with the two lower doses and placebo. Based on safety and early efficacy results from an interim analysis, a decision will be made to either continue with the two lower doses or drop one or both and introduce the highest dose instead. This design borrows information across baskets for safety assessment, while efficacy is assessed separately for each basket. The proposed adaptive design addresses several key challenges: (1) The trial must begin with only the two lower doses because reassuring safety data from these doses is required before escalating to a higher dose. (2) Due to the expected speed of recruitment, adaptation decisions must rely on an earlier, surrogate endpoint. (3) The primary outcome is a count variable that follows a mixture distribution with an atom at 0. To control the familywise error rate in the strong sense when comparing multiple doses to the control in the adaptive design, we extend the partial conditional error approach to accommodate the inclusion of new hypotheses after the interim analysis. In a comprehensive simulation study we evaluate various design options and analysis strategies, assessing the robustness of the design under different design assumptions and parameter values. We identify scenarios where the adaptive design improves the trial's ability to identify an optimal dose. Adaptive dose selection enables resource allocation to the most promising treatment arms, increasing the likelihood of selecting the optimal dose while reducing the required overall sample size and trial duration."}

The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into EMS design enables optimized microgrid control strategies for coordinating DERs. Building on this, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based EMS framework to provide flexible scalability for microgrids, enhance resilience and reduce operational costs during power outages.

In small and early-stage cloud deployments, however, log retention policies are frequently configured far beyond operational requirements, often defaulting to 90 days or more, without explicit consideration of their financial and performance implications. As a result, excessive log retention becomes a hidden and recurring cost.\n  This study examines the financial and operational impact of log retention window selection from a cost-aware perspective. Using synthetic log datasets designed to reflect real-world variability in log volume and access patterns, we evaluate retention windows of 7, 14, 30, and 90 days. The analysis focuses on three metrics: storage cost, operationally useful log ratio, and cost per useful log. Operational usefulness is defined as log data accessed during simulated debugging and incident analysis tasks.\n  The results show that reducing log retention from 90 days to 14 days can lower log storage costs by up to 78 percent while preserving more than 97 percent of operationally useful logs. Longer retention windows provide diminishing operational returns while disproportionately increasing storage cost and query overhead. These findings suggest that modest configuration changes can yield significant cost savings without compromising system reliability.\n  Rather than proposing new logging mechanisms, this work offers a lightweight and accessible framework to help small engineering teams reason about log retention policies through a cost-effectiveness lens. The study aims to encourage more deliberate observability configurations, particularly in resource-constrained cloud environments."}

Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization heuristics and deep learning baselines in terms of system sum rate, convergence speed, and generalization capability."}

The set of candidates for the tuning parameter includes not only positive values but also zero and negative values. We demonstrate that if the second moment of the specification error converges to zero, generalized cross-validation is still a uniformly consistent estimator of the out-of-sample prediction risk. This implies that generalized cross-validation selects the tuning parameter for which ridge regression asymptotically achieves the smallest prediction risk among the candidates if the degree of misspecification for the regression function is small. Our simulation studies show that ridge regression tuned by generalized cross-validation exhibits a prediction performance similar to that of optimally tuned ridge regression and outperforms the Lasso under correct and incorrect model specifications."}

Meanwhile, deep neural networks (DNNs), which are effective for factory output prediction and operational optimization, require extensive historical data, posing challenges due to high sensor deployment and data collection costs. To address this, we propose Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning (EDTL), a novel framework that enhances prediction accuracy and data efficiency by integrating transfer learning with an ensemble strategy and a feature alignment layer. EDTL pretrains DNN models on data-rich production lines (source domain) and adapts them to data-limited lines (target domain), reducing dependency on large datasets. Experiments on real-world textile factory datasets show that EDTL improves prediction accuracy by 5.66% and enhances model robustness by 3.96% compared to conventional DNNs, particularly in data-limited scenarios (20%-40% data availability). This research contributes to energy-efficient textile manufacturing by enabling accurate predictions with fewer data requirements, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for smart production systems."}

We focus on the scenario where only two induced subgraphs are sampled, and characterize the sample size threshold for detection. At the information-theoretic level, we establish the sample complexity rates that are optimal up to constant factors over most parameter regimes, and the remaining gap is bounded by a subpolynomial factor.

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration."}

To address these issues, we propose EPD-Serve, a stage-level disaggregated inference serving system for multimodal models. EPD-Serve decouples the inference pipeline into independent Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages, enabling logical isolation and flexible co-located deployment through dynamic orchestration.

The most common implementation of MCP, proposed by Anthropic, heavily relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose tasks and issue instructions to servers, which act as stateless executors. In particular, the agents, models, and servers are stateless and do not have access to a global context. However, in tasks involving LLM-driven coordination, it is natural that a Shared Context Store (SCS) could improve the efficiency and coherence of multi-agent workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling knowledge transfer between servers. Thus, in this work, we design and assess the performance of a Context-Aware MCP (CA-MCP) that offloads execution logic to specialized MCP servers that read from and write to a shared context memory, allowing them to coordinate more autonomously in real time. In this design, context management serves as the central mechanism that maintains continuity across task executions by tracking intermediate states and shared variables, thereby enabling persistent collaboration among agents without repeated prompting. We present experiments showing that the CA-MCP can outperform the traditional MCP by reducing the number of LLM calls required for complex tasks and decreasing the frequency of response failures when task conditions are not satisfied, thereby improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. In particular, we conducted experiments on the TravelPlanner and REALM-Bench benchmark datasets and observed statistically significant results indicating the potential advantages of incorporating a shared context store via CA-MCP in LLM-driven multi-agent systems."}

To address these challenges, this paper investigates the trade-off between carbon emissions and downlink throughput in cellular networks, offering insights into optimizing both network performance and sustainability. The renewable energy state of base station batteries and the number of occupied channels are modeled as a quasi-birth-death process. We construct models for the probability of channel blocking, average successful transmission probability for users, downlink throughput, carbon emissions, and carbon efficiency based on stochastic geometry. Based on these analyses, an energy-based cell association scheme is proposed to optimize the carbon efficiency of cellular networks. The results show that, compared to the closest cell association scheme, the energy-based cell association scheme is capable of reducing the carbon emissions of the network by 13.0% and improving the carbon efficiency by 11.3%."}

During the sensing phase, user locations are estimated and used to construct location-aware channels, which are then exploited in the subsequent communication phase. By explicitly modeling the coupling between sensing-induced localization errors and channel-estimation errors, we capture the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and communication throughput. Based on this model, we jointly optimize the time-allocation ratio, sensing covariance matrix, and robust downlink beamforming under imperfect channel state information (CSI). The resulting non-convex problem is addressed via a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based reformulation within an alternating-optimization framework. To further reduce computational complexity, we also propose two low-complexity suboptimal designs: an error-ignorant scheme and a maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves localization accuracy over far-field and monostatic setups, thereby reducing channel estimation errors and ultimately enhancing the achievable rate. Moreover, the error-ignorant scheme performs well under stringent sensing requirements, whereas the MRT-based scheme remains robust over a wide range of sensing requirements by adapting the time-allocation ratio, albeit with some beamforming loss."}

A dump located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin served as the research site for a multi-method analysis combining remote sensing and field-based data. Two UAV survey campaigns were conducted, capturing RGB, infrared, and multispectral imagery. These were supplemented with direct ground measurements of subsurface temperature and detailed vegetation mapping. Additionally, publicly available satellite data from the Landsat and Sentinel missions were analysed. A range of vegetation and fire-related indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, BAI, among others) were calculated to identify thermally active zones and assess vegetation conditions within these degraded areas. The results revealed strong seasonal variability in vegetation indices on thermally active sites, with evidence of disrupted vegetation cycles, including winter greening in moderately heated root zones - a pattern indicative of stress and degradation processes. While satellite data proved useful in reconstructing the fire history of the dump, their spatial resolution was insufficient for detailed monitoring of small-scale thermal anomalies. The study highlights the diagnostic potential of UAV-based remote sensing in post-industrial environments undergoing land degradation but emphasises the importance of field validation for accurate environmental assessment."}

To address this scenario, we propose CodeSep, a codec-driven model that jointly performs speech separation and low-bitrate compression. CodeSep comprises a residual vector quantizer (RVQ)-based plain neural speech codec, a base-token disentanglement (BTD) module, and parallel auxiliary-token serial prediction (ATSP) modules. The BTD module disentangles mixed-speech mel-spectrograms into base tokens for each speaker, which are then refined by ATSP modules to serially predict auxiliary tokens, and finally, all tokens are decoded to reconstruct separated waveforms through the codec decoder. During training, the codec's RVQ provides supervision with permutation-invariant and teacher-forcing-based cross-entropy losses. As only base tokens are transmitted or stored, CodeSep achieves low-bitrate compression. Experimental results show that CodeSep attains satisfactory separation performance at only 1 kbps compared with baseline methods."}

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics."}

Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by non-Gaussian distributions inherent to nonlinear observation channels, we establish sufficient conditions by imposing regularity assumptions, specifically log-concavity, on the system's probabilistic components. We show that under these conditions, the divergence of differential entropy implies the convergence of the estimation error, thereby closing the gap between information-theoretic bounds and estimation performance. By establishing these results, we unveil the fundamental performance limits imposed by the sensing layer, extending classical data-rate constraints to the more challenging regime of nonlinear observation models."}

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness."}

We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

Specifically, an end-to-end semantic distortion function is approximated by deriving an upper bound composing of source and channel coding induced components, and then a hybrid Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB) is also derived for target position under imperfect time synchronization. To facilitate the joint optimization, a distortion minimization problem is formulated by considering the HCRB threshold, channel uses, and power budget. Subsequently, an alternative optimization algorithm composed of successive convex approximation and fractional programming is proposed to address this problem by decoupling it into two subproblems for coding rate and beamforming designs, respectively.

We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices.

The data span 2,557 days from January 2019 through December 2025 in a large North American region. Three findings emerge. First, GBV concentrates more heavily in mid-range horizons: beyond 90 days, GBV tail mass typically exceeds Nights by 20-50%, with ratios reaching 75% at the 180-day threshold during peak seasons. Second, Gamma and Weibull distributions fit comparably well under interval-censored cross-entropy. Gamma wins on 61% of days for Nights and 52% for GBV, with Weibull close behind at 38% and 45%. Lognormal rarely wins (<3%). Nonparametric GAMs achieve 18-80x lower CRPS but sacrifice interpretability. Third, generalized Pareto fits suggest bounded tails for both metrics at thresholds below 150 days, though this may partly reflect right-truncation at 365 days; above 150 days, estimates destabilize. Bai-Perron tests with HAC standard errors identify five structural breaks in the Wasserstein distance series, with early breaks coinciding with COVID-19 disruptions. The results show that volume and revenue lead-time shapes diverge systematically, that simple two-parameter distributions capture daily pmfs adequately, and that tail inference requires care near truncation boundaries."}

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 ε^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $ε^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach.

T1-weighted (T1w) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to identify macroscopic brain alterations, but these changes typically emerge relatively late in the disease course. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), in contrast, is sensitive to earlier microstructural abnormalities by probing water diffusion in brain tissue. dMRI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), provide complementary information about white matter integrity and neurodegeneration. However, dMRI acquisitions are time-consuming and susceptible to motion artifacts, limiting their routine use in clinical populations. To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (>0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%->83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice."}

Pixel antennas represent a general class of reconfigurable antenna designs in which the radiating surface, regardless of its shape or size, is divided into sub-wavelength elements called pixels. Each pixel is connected to its neighboring elements through radio frequency switches. By controlling pixel connections, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured. However, conventional pixel antennas have only a single, fixed-position feeding port, which is not efficient for angular sensing. Therefore, in this work, we further extend the reconfigurability of pixel antennas by introducing the HRPA, which enables both geometry control of the pixel antenna and switching of its feeding ports. The model of the proposed HRPA, including both circuit and radiation parameters, is derived. A codebook is then defined, consisting of pixel connection states and feeding port positions for each sensing area. Based on this codebook, an efficient optimization approach is developed to minimize the Cram\\acute{\\mathrm{\\mathbf{e}}}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and obtain the optimal HRPA geometries for angular sensing within a given area. Numerical results show that the HRPA reduces the angle estimation error by more than 50% across the full three-dimensional sphere when compared with a conventional uniform planar array of the same size. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlights the potential of HRPA for integrated sensing and communication systems."}

These logs are often multi-channel, non-stationary, and anomalies are rare, making anomaly detection challenging.

Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection.

Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D. We compare the models' performance across short-term (15 to 120 min) and long term (3 to more than 24 hours) prediction horizons (PHs).

The results show that 1) a PH of up to 1 hour provides the best results. 2) Conventional ML methods yield the best results for classification and DL for regression.

We further provide a statistical inference procedure by developing a new asymptotic theory for cross-validated prediction error. Finally, we apply this method to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

Each relay node follows the OP-minimized principle to choose the forwarding schemes. To reduce self-interference and avoid multi-user interference, half-duplex relays and frequency division multiple access schemes are considered, respectively. On this basis, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem to mitigate the rate loss introduced by the half-duplex mode. To solve this problem, we first transform the original nonconvex problem into a power control optimization problem by obtaining the closed form of bandwidth allocation and substituting it into the original problem.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size.

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImmersiveFlow, the first end-to-end generative framework that directly synthesizes discrete 7.1.4 format spatial audio from stereo input. ImmersiveFlow leverages Flow Matching to learn trajectories from stereo inputs to multichannel spatial features within a pretrained VAE latent space. At inference, the Flow Matching model predicted latent features are decoded by the VAE and converted into the final 7.1.4 waveform. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method produces perceptually rich sound fields and enhanced externalization, significantly outperforming traditional upmixing techniques.

For equal-share designs, we apply recent theory for finely stratified experiments to Lee bounds, yielding closed-form, design-consistent variance estimators and properly sized confidence intervals. Simulations show that the conventional formula can overstate uncertainty, while our approach delivers tighter intervals. When treatment shares differ across strata, we propose a new strategy, which combines inverse probability weighting and global trimming to construct valid bounds even when strata are small or unbalanced. We establish identification, introduce a moment estimator, and extend existing inference results to stratified designs with heterogeneous shares, covering a broad class of moment-based estimators which includes the one we formulate. We also generalize our results to designs in which strata are defined solely by observed labels."}

This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$.

Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$.

I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $τ^{Δ,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_Δ$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors.

The stability properties of Sinkhorn bridges when the number of iterations tends to infinity is a very active research area in applied probability and machine learning. Traditional proofs of convergence are mainly based on nonlinear versions of Perron-Frobenius theory and related Hilbert projective metric techniques, gradient descent, Bregman divergence techniques and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, including propagation of convexity profiles based on coupling diffusions by reflection methods. The objective of this review article is to present, in a self-contained manner, recently developed Sinkhorn/Gibbs-type semigroup analysis based upon contraction coefficients and Lyapunov-type operator-theoretic techniques. These powerful, off-the-shelf semigroup methods are based upon transportation cost inequalities (e.g. log-Sobolev, Talagrand quadratic inequality, curvature estimates), $φ$-divergences, Kantorovich-type criteria and Dobrushin contraction-type coefficients on weighted Banach spaces as well as Wasserstein distances.

Phase 1 employs a parallel segmented sieve to enumerate primes up to $2n$ and applies Legendre's formula to determine the precise prime factorization of $C(n)$. The primes are grouped by exponent and serialized to disk. Phase 2 reconstructs the final integer using a memory-efficient balanced product tree with chunking. The algorithm runs on a time complexity of $Θ(n(\\log n)^2)$ bit-operations and a space complexity of $Θ(n \\log n)$ bits. This result represents the largest exact Catalan number computed to date.

This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments."}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

Through extensive simulations, it is shown that for agile flight scenarios with wind and small initial position error, both guidance strategies achieve comparable tracking performance, indicating that the additional complexity introduced by the GVF formulation is not always justified. However, the GVF-based approach exhibits an advantage when initial deviation from the path is present, yielding smooth and well-behaved convergence toward the desired path.

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality.

We then propose simple yet effective privacy-preserving distributed algorithms, and show that with appropriate randomized initialization and parameter choices, our proposed approaches can attach the derived optimal bounds for the considered operators.

The policy is modeled as a matched, bounded input, and Lyapunov-based conditions link SMC gains to the admissible feedforward bound, guaranteeing stability under saturation. This formulation is applicable to nonlinear, underactuated plants with hard constraints. To illustrate the methodology, the method is applied to a six-degree-of-freedom aircraft model and compared with Reinforcement Learning and isolated SMC. Simulation results show that the hybrid controller improves transient behavior and reduces control oscillations compared to standalone RL and SMC controllers, while preserving robustness under modeling uncertainties and disturbances.

This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold. The algorithms span a trade-off between speed, provable accuracy, and scalability, enabling compression-aware clustering with explicit error control. Code is available online."}

With the competitive vocoder Vocos as its backbone, the proposed model ranked fourth on Track 1 in the 2025 LRAC Challenge and achieved the highest subjective evaluation score (MUSHRA) on the clean speech test set. Additionally, we cascade a lightweight neural network at the front end to extend its capability of speech enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that the two systems achieve competitive performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Speech samples can be found at https://acceleration123.github.io/."}

We present a verification-based computational framework for historical drawing authentication using one-class autoencoders trained on a compact set of interpretable handcrafted features. Ten artist-specific verifiers are trained using authenticated sketches from the Metropolitan Museum of Art open-access collection, the Ashmolean Collections Catalogue, the Morgan Library and Museum, the Royal Collection Trust (UK), the Victoria and Albert Museum Collections, and an online catalogue of the Casa Buonarroti collection and evaluated under a biometric-style protocol with genuine and impostor trials. Feature vectors comprise Fourier-domain energy, Shannon entropy, global contrast, GLCM-based homogeneity, and a box-counting estimate of fractal complexity. Across 900 verification decisions (90 genuine and 810 impostor trials), the pooled system achieves a True Acceptance Rate of 83.3% with a False Acceptance Rate of 9.5% at the chosen operating point. Performance varies substantially by artist, with near-zero false acceptance for some verifiers and elevated confusability for others. A pairwise attribution of false accepts indicates structured error pathways consistent with stylistic proximity and shared drawing conventions, whilst also motivating tighter control of digitisation artefacts and threshold calibration. The proposed methodology is designed to complement, rather than replace, connoisseurship by providing reproducible, quantitative evidence suitable for data-scarce settings common in historical sketch attribution."}

To avoid the heavy computational burden of solving a nonlinear programming problem directly, this paper proposes a novel Convex Model Predictive Control (CMPC) approach based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) scheme. The core of our method lies in transforming the nonlinear constraints into linear forms: we linearize the system dynamics and convexify the discrete-time high-order control barrier functions using a proposed tangent-line projection method. Consequently, the original problem is reduced to a quadratic program that can be iteratively solved within the SQP scheme at each time step of CMPC. Furthermore, we provide the formal guarantee of the convergence of the SQP scheme, and subsequently guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of CMPC. Simulations on multi-agent systems with unicycle dynamics demonstrate a 35-52 times reduction in computation time compared with baseline methods, confirming the suitability of the proposed approach for real-time safe output consensus control."}

The model is parsimonious, computationally efficient, easily scalable to high dimensions, and performs well for both simulated and empirical data. In an empirical application to financial market dynamics using 100 stocks from 10 different countries and 10 different industry sectors, we find that our copula model captures both geographic and industry related co-movements and outperforms recent computationally more intensive clustering-based factor copula alternatives.

Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality."}

Regularization is commonly employed to mitigate ill-posedness by incorporating prior information and structural constraints. However, classical regularization formulations are frequently infeasible in this setting due to prohibitive memory requirements, necessitating sequential methods that process data and state information online, eliminating the need to form the full space-time problem. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient framework for reconstructing dynamic sequences of undersampled images from computerized tomography data that requires minimal hyperparameter tuning. The approach is based on a prior-informed, dimension-reduced Kalman filter with smoothing. While well suited for dynamic image reconstruction, practical deployment is challenging when the state transition model and covariance parameters must be initialized without prior knowledge and estimated in a single pass. To address these limitations, we integrate regularized motion models with expectation-maximization strategies for the estimation of state transition dynamics and error covariances within the Kalman filtering framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on limited-angle and single-shot computerized tomography problems, highlighting improvements in reconstruction accuracy, memory efficiency, and computational cost."}

We observe that the 28-layer Transformer architecture of FreeFlow can be characterized as an Euler discretization scheme for an ODE along the depth axis, where the layer index serves as the discrete time step. Therefore, we distill the number of layers of the FreeFlow model, following the same derivation logic as FreeFlow, and propose SLT (Single-Layer Transformer), which uses a single shared DiT block to approximate the depth-wise feature evolution of the 28-layer teacher. During training, it matches the teacher's intermediate features at several depth patches, fuses those patch-level representations, and simultaneously aligns the teacher's final velocity prediction. Through distillation training, we compress the 28 independent Transformer Blocks of the teacher model DiT-XL/2 into a single Transformer Block, reducing the parameter count from 675M to 4.3M. Furthermore, leveraging its minimal parameters and rapid sampling speed, SLT can screen more candidate points in the noise space within the same timeframe, thereby selecting higher-quality initial points for the teacher model FreeFlow and ultimately enhancing the quality of generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that within a time budget comparable to two random samplings of the teacher model, our method performs over 100 noise screenings and produces a high-quality sample through the teacher model using the selected points. Quality fluctuations caused by low-quality initial noise under a limited number of FreeFlow sampling calls are effectively avoided, substantially improving the stability and average generation quality of one-step generation."}

Nevertheless, such technologies also offer a promising opportunity to manage traffic non-intrusively by shaping the information delivered to users, thereby mitigating congestion and enhancing network stability. A key step toward this goal is to identify information signals that ensure the existence of an equilibrium with desirable stability and convergence properties. This challenge is particularly relevant when traffic density and routing dynamics evolve concurrently, as increasingly occurs with digital signaling and real-time navigation technologies. To address this, we analyze a parallel-path transportation network with a single origin-destination pair, incorporating joint traffic density and logit-based routing dynamics that evolve at the same timescale. We characterize a class of density-dependent traffic information that guarantees a unique equilibrium in the free-flow regime, ensures its asymptotic stability, and keeps traffic densities within the free-flow region for all time. The theoretical results are complemented by a numerical case study demonstrating how the framework can inform the design of traffic information that reduces total travel time without compromising credibility."}

In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric.

We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the advantages of BADR over existing Pareto-efficient approaches to fairness."}

From interactions across rollouts, CASC adaptively constructs attention boundaries that concentrate computation on the most informative regions of the scene. We further design a Distance-Based Advantage that provides fine-grained learning signals based on distance rather than binary correctness, improving both grounding accuracy and compression quality.

In this study, we present the first application of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) as a non-invasive diagnosis tool in plant pathology. Compared with conventional molecular, spectroscopic, and immunoassay-based methods, THz-TDS offers distinct advantages, including non-contact, non-destructive, and preparation-free measurement, enabling rapid in situ screening of plant and soil samples. Our results demonstrate that THz-TDS can differentiate between healthy and clubroot-infected tissues by detecting both structural and biochemical alterations. Specifically, infected roots exhibit a blue shift in the refractive index in the low-frequency THz range, along with distinct peaks-indicative of disruptions in water transport and altered metabolic activity in both roots and leaves. Interestingly, the characteristic root swelling observed in infected plants reflects internal tissue disorganization rather than an actual increase in water content. Furthermore, a physics-constrained neural network is proposed to extract the main feature in THz-TDS. A comprehensive evaluation, including time-domain signals, amplitude and phase images, refractive index and absorption coefficient maps, and principal component analysis, provides enhanced contrast and spatial resolution compared to raw time-domain or frequency signals. These findings suggest that THz-TDS holds significant potential for early, non-destructive detection of plant diseases and may serve as a valuable tool to limit their spread in agricultural systems."}

We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond."}

To address these limitations, we propose ViEBench, a process-verifiable benchmark designed to evaluate faithful visual reasoning. Comprising 200 multi-scenario high-resolution images with expert-annotated visual evidence, ViEBench uniquely categorizes tasks by difficulty into perception and reasoning dimensions, where reasoning tasks require utilizing localized visual details with prior knowledge. To establish comprehensive evaluation criteria, we introduce a dual-axis matrix that provides fine-grained metrics through four diagnostic quadrants, enabling transparent diagnosis of model behavior across varying task complexities.

In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors. Our derivation highlights the central role of additive functionals in separating bounded microscopic corrections from unbounded macroscopic transport and clarifies the connection between reversible and nonequilibrium steady states.

In this work, we propose an automatic issue discovery method based on multimodal LLM agents. Our approach automatically recalls short videos containing potential new issues and applies a two-stage clustering strategy to group them, with each cluster corresponding to a newly discovered issue. The agent then generates updated annotation policies from these clusters, thereby extending coverage to these emerging issues. Our agent has been deployed in the real system. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that this agent-based method significantly improves the effectiveness of emerging-issue discovery (with an F1 score improvement of over 20%) and enhances the performance of subsequent issue governance (reducing the view count of problematic videos by approximately 15%). More importantly, compared to manual issue discovery, it greatly reduces time costs and substantially accelerates the iteration of annotation policies."}

To derive the density functions for normal and post-outage market signals, we exploit multi-parametric programming to decompose complex market signals into parametric random variables with a known density. These densities are then used to construct a QCD-based statistic that triggers an alarm as soon as the statistic exceeds an appropriate threshold. Numerical experiments on a stylized PJM testbed demonstrate rapid line outage identification from public streams of electricity demand and price data."}

In this context, one promising strategy is cell switching (CS), which dynamically deactivates underutilized small base stations (SBSs) to reduce power consumption. However, while previous research explored CS primarily based on traffic load, ensuring user quality of service (QoS) under realistic channel conditions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-driven CS framework that jointly minimizes network power consumption and guarantees user QoS by enforcing a minimum received power threshold as part of offloading decisions. In contrast to prior load-based or learning-based approaches, our method explicitly integrates channel-aware information into the CS process, thus ensuring reliable service quality for offloaded users. Furthermore, flexibility of the proposed framework enables operators to adapt system behavior between energy-saving and QoS-preserving modes by tuning a single design parameter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 30% power savings as compared to baseline methods while fully maintaining QoS under diverse network conditions. Scalability and robustness of the proposed method in realistic heterogeneous networks (HetNets) further highlight its potential as a practical solution for sustainable 6G deployments."}

We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications.

While prior research has evaluated cost and emissions impacts of hourly vs. annual TMR, these studies typically rely on single-year weather scenarios that do not capture inter-annual variability in variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. We use a capacity expansion model to assess how inter-annual weather variability affects procurement-driven infrastructure investments, costs, and emissions for a grid-connected hydrogen producer under both annual and hourly time-matching strategies. Using a Texas case study, we compare deterministic (single weather scenario) and stochastic (nine weather scenarios) modeling approaches. Both procurement investments and cost and emissions outcomes are sensitive to weather scenario, with annual matching exhibiting greater sensitivity than hourly matching. Stochastic modeling finds higher cost premiums for hourly versus annual matching compared to deterministic modeling, though emissions trends remain directionally consistent. Demand flexibility through H2 storage is critical for lowering hourly matching cost premiums under weather-driven VRE variability. Partial hourly matching (e.g., 80-90% compliance) can modestly reduce costs while maintaining minimal emissions impacts. Finally, we examine how grid-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) affect additionality and emissions. When stringent additionality is achieved via binding RPS constraints on non-H2 electricity demand, annual matching can produce emissions reductions comparable to hourly matching at lower cost."}

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

Our method integrates conformal quantile regression with image reconstruction methods to estimate statistically rigorous pixel-wise uncertainty intervals. We trained and evaluated our model on Cartesian undersampled brain and knee data obtained from the fastMRI dataset using acceleration factors ranging from 2 to 10. An end-to-end Variational Network was used for image reconstruction. Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong agreement between predicted uncertainty maps and true reconstruction error. Using our method, the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 90% at acceleration levels at and above four-fold; whereas it dropped to less than 70% when the uncertainty was computed using a simpler a heuristic notion (magnitude of the residual). Qualitative examples further show the uncertainty maps based on quantile regression capture the magnitude and spatial distribution of reconstruction errors across acceleration factors, with regions of elevated uncertainty aligning with pathologies and artifacts. The proposed framework enables evaluation of reconstruction quality without access to fully-sampled ground-truth reference images.

Such maximin design problems abound in statistical applications and present unique theoretical and computational challenges. Building on the differential structure of the $2$-Wasserstein space, we derive explicit formulas for the Wasserstein gradient of the $E$-optimality criterion in the simple-eigenvalue case. For higher multiplicities, we propose a Wasserstein steepest ascent direction and show that it can be computed exactly via a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We develop particle approximations that connect infinite-dimensional flows with finite-dimensional optimization, and provide approximation guarantees for empirical measures. Our framework extends naturally to constrained designs via projected Wasserstein gradient flows.

However, on the microscopic scale these metastable wells are very different from Erdős--Rényi models, with the total variation distance between the two measures tending to 1 [MX23]. In this article we clarify this situation by providing a sharp (up to constants) bound on the Hamming-Wasserstein distance between the two models, which is the average number of edges at which they differ, under the coupling which minimizes this average. In particular, we show that this distance is $Θ(n^{3/2})$, quantifying exactly how these models differ. \n  An upper bound of this form has appeared in the past [RR19], but this was restricted to the subcritical (high-temperature) regime of parameters. We extend this bound, using a new proof technique, to the supercritical (low-temperature) regime, and prove a matching lower bound which has only previously appeared in the subcritical regime of special cases of ERGMs satisfying a \"triangle-free\" condition [DF25]. To prove the lower bound in the presence of triangles, we introduce an approximation of the discrete derivative of the Hamiltonian, which controls the dynamical properties of the ERGM, in terms of local counts of triangles and wedges (two-stars) near an edge. This approximation is the main technical and conceptual contribution of the article, and we expect it will be useful in a variety of other contexts as well.

Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we develop a tokenization framework that segments Indonesian text at syllable boundaries before applying byte-pair encoding, creating a vocabulary that aligns with the language's morphophonological structure. Our approach first identifies high-frequency syllables through rule-based segmentation, then constructs a compact vocabulary of 3,500 tokens that preserves meaningful linguistic units while maintaining coverage through character-level fallback. Empirical evaluation on Indonesian Wikipedia and folklore corpora from Indonesian Culture Digital Library (PDBI) demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional tokenization methods: the syllable-based approach achieves Rényi efficiency of 0.74 compared to 0.50-0.64 for pretrained multilingual tokenizers, while maintaining higher average token lengths (3.67 characters versus 2.72 for GPT-2) despite using a vocabulary an order of magnitude smaller. These gains emerge from the method's ability to internalize character-level dependencies within syllable units, reducing the computational burden on language models while respecting Indonesian's agglutinative morphology. We call the LLM built upon this principle, TOBA LLM (Tokenisasi Optimum Berbasis Aglutinasi), the convergence of human literacy pedagogy with computational optimization principles offers a promising paradigm for developing linguistically-informed tokenization strategies, particularly for morphologically rich and underrepresented languages in natural language processing."}

Nevertheless, underwater communication is constrained by narrow bandwidth, high latency, and strict energy constraints, which are the source of efficiency problems in traditional data-centric networks. To tackle these problematic issues, this work provides a survey of recent advances in Semantic Communication (SC) for IoUT, a novel communication paradigm that seeks to harness not raw symbol information but rather its meaning and/or contextual significance. In this paper, we investigate the emerging advanced AI-powered frameworks, including large language models (LLMs), diffusion-based generative encoders, and federated learning (FL), that bridge semantic compression with context-aware prioritization and robust information reconstruction over noisy underwater channels. Hybrid acoustic-optical-RF architectures and edge-intelligent semantic encoders are also considered enablers of sustainable, adaptive operations. Examples in underwater archaeology, marine ecology, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordination are provided as a relief to illustrate the merits of meaning-driven connectivity. The paper concludes with some recommendations, including semantic representations standardization, cross-domain interpolation, and privacy-support schemes. These issues must be addressed in the future before trustworthy SC-enabled IoUT systems can be developed for underwater communication."}

We show that TPBS models admit a closed-form expression for the Dirichlet energy, and reveal scenarios where perfect interpolation is possible with exponentially small Dirichlet energy. This renders global Dirichlet energy-based regularization ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization."}

For safe deployment in robotics and autonomous systems, we need to predict when to trust VLM spatial predictions rather than accepting all outputs. We propose a vision-based confidence estimation framework that validates VLM predictions through independent geometric verification using object detection. Unlike text-based approaches relying on self-assessment, our method fuses four signals via gradient boosting: geometric alignment between VLM claims and coordinates, spatial ambiguity from overlap, detection quality, and VLM internal uncertainty. We achieve 0.674 AUROC on BLIP-2 (34.0% improvement over text-based baselines) and 0.583 AUROC on CLIP (16.1% improvement), generalizing across generative and classification architectures. Our framework enables selective prediction: at 60% target accuracy, we achieve 61.9% coverage versus 27.6% baseline (2.2x improvement) on BLIP-2. Feature analysis reveals vision-based signals contribute 87.4% of model importance versus 12.7% from VLM confidence, validating that external geometric verification outperforms self-assessment. We demonstrate reliable scene graph construction where confidence-based pruning improves precision from 52.1% to 78.3% while retaining 68.2% of edges."}

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

However, it is significantly impeded by challenges such as the coexistence of densely packed and sparsely distributed cells, complex overlapping morphologies, and severe class imbalance. Conventional deep learning models often fail to preserve fine topological details or accurately delineate boundaries under these conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, IMSAHLO (Integrating Multi-Scale Attention and Hybrid Loss Optimization), for robust and adaptive neuronal segmentation. The core of our model features Multi-Scale Dense Blocks (MSDBs) to capture features at various receptive fields, effectively handling variations in cell density, and a Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism that adaptively focuses on salient morphological features to preserve Region of Interest (ROI) boundary details. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid loss function synergistically combining Tversky and Focal loss to combat class imbalance, alongside a topology-aware Centerline Dice (clDice) loss and a Contour-Weighted Boundary loss to ensure topological continuity and precise separation of adjacent cells. Large-scale experiments on the public Fluorescent Neuronal Cells (FNC) dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, achieving precision of 81.4%, macro F1 score of 82.7%, micro F1 score of 83.3%, and balanced accuracy of 99.5% on difficult dense and sparse cases. Ablation studies validate the synergistic benefits of multi-scale attention and hybrid loss terms. This work establishes a foundation for generalizable segmentation models applicable to a wide range of biomedical imaging modalities, pushing AI-assisted analysis toward high-throughput neurobiological pipelines."}

We present VAST (Vascular Flow Analysis and Segmentation), an automated, unsupervised pipeline for intracranial 4D Flow MRI that couples vessel segmentation with physics-informed velocity reconstruction. VAST derives vessel masks directly from complex 4D Flow data by iteratively fusing magnitude- and phase-based background statistics. It then reconstructs velocities via continuity-constrained phase unwrapping, outlier correction, and low-rank denoising to reduce noise and aliasing while promoting mass-consistent flow fields, with processing completing in minutes per case on a standard CPU. We validate VAST on synthetic data from an internal carotid artery aneurysm model across SNR = 2-20 and severe phase wrapping (up to five-fold), on in vitro Poiseuille flow, and on an in vivo internal carotid aneurysm dataset. In synthetic benchmarks, VAST maintains near quarter-voxel surface accuracy and reduces velocity root-mean-square error by up to fourfold under the most degraded conditions. In vitro, it segments the channel within approximately half a voxel of expert annotations and reduces velocity error by 39% (unwrapped) and 77% (aliased). In vivo, VAST closely matches expert time-of-flight masks and lowers divergence residuals by about 30%, indicating a more self-consistent intracranial flow field. By automating processing and enforcing basic flow physics, VAST helps move intracranial 4D Flow MRI toward routine quantitative use in cerebrovascular assessment."}

Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors."}

Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism.

Valid for Rician fading channels with minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive combining and MMSE channel estimation, these expressions depend exclusively on long-term channel statistics, providing a tractable alternative to computationally expensive instantaneous CSI-driven optimization. Building on these results, we develop statistical-CSI-based algorithms for joint subarray selection, users scheduling, and pilot assignment, leveraging the derived SINR approximations to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) among scheduled users while preserving computational tractability. The proposed framework exploits the spatial sparsity of user equipment (UE) visibility regions (VRs) to enable more aggressive pilot reuse than is possible in conventional massive MIMO.

Integrating edge devices into the LLM inference process via speculative decoding helps balance the workload between the edge and the cloud, while maintaining lossless prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify and formalize two critical bottlenecks that limit the efficiency and scalability of distributed speculative LLM serving: Wasted Drafting Time and Verification Interference. To address these challenges, we propose WISP, an efficient and SLO-aware distributed LLM inference system that consists of an intelligent speculation controller, a verification time estimator, and a verification batch scheduler.

However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs, sensitivity to user interactions, and degraded performance when the foreground and background share similar color distributions. A key factor influencing segmentation performance is the similarity measure used for assigning edge weights in the graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pixel Segment Similarity Index (PSSI), which leverages the harmonic mean of inter-channel similarities by incorporating both pixel intensity and spatial smoothness features. The harmonic mean effectively penalizes dissimilarities in any individual channel, enhancing robustness. The computational complexity of PSSI is $\\mathcal{O}(B)$, where $B$ denotes the number of histogram bins. Our segmentation framework begins with low-level segmentation using MeanShift, which effectively captures color, texture, and segment shape. Based on the resulting pixel segments, we construct a pixel-segment graph with edge weights determined by PSSI. For partitioning, we employ the Maximum Spanning Tree (MaxST), which captures strongly connected local neighborhoods beneficial for precise segmentation. The integration of the proposed PSSI, MeanShift, and MaxST allows our method to jointly capture color similarity, smoothness, texture, shape, and strong local connectivity. Experimental evaluations on the GrabCut and Images250 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms current graph-based interactive segmentation methods such as AMOE, OneCut, and SSNCut in terms of segmentation quality, as measured by Jaccard Index (IoU), $F_1$ score, execution time and Mean Error (ME).

Unlike existing works that mostly assume perfect channel state information (CSI) or location information of Eves, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario, where the locations of Bobs are perfectly known, while only imperfect location information of Eves is available at the BS. We first formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of Bobs while guaranteeing a worst-case limit on the eavesdropping rate under location uncertainty. By transforming Cartesian position errors into the polar domain, we reveal an important near-field angular-error amplification effect: for the same location error, the closer the Eve, the larger the angle error, severely degrading the performance of conventional robust beamforming methods based on imperfect channel state information. To address this issue, we first establish the conditions for which the first-order Taylor approximation of the near-field channel steering vector under location uncertainty is largely accurate. Then, we propose a two-stage robust beamforming method, which first partitions the uncertainty region into multiple fan-shaped sub-regions, followed by the second stage to formulate and solve a refined linear-matrix-inequality (LMI)-based robust beamforming optimization problem. In addition, the proposed method is further extended to scenarios with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves. Finally, numerical results validate that the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between rate performance and secrecy robustness, hence significantly outperforming existing benchmarks under Eve location uncertainty."}

The establishment of benchmarks like SWE-bench revealed this task as profoundly difficult for large language models, thereby significantly accelerating the evolution of autonomous coding agents. This paper presents a systematic survey of this emerging domain. We begin by examining data construction pipelines, covering automated collection and synthesis approaches. We then provide a comprehensive analysis of methodologies, spanning training-free frameworks with their modular components to training-based techniques, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Subsequently, we discuss critical analyses of data quality and agent behavior, alongside practical applications.

More than one hundred recordings were collected from dogs across four continents, with thirty eight recordings annotated by board certified veterinary cardiologists for quantitative evaluation. SoNUS version 3.2.x employs a multi-stage fallback architecture with quality-aware filtering to ensure reliable output under variable recording conditions. The primary sixty second model achieved mean and median heart rate accuracies of ninety one point six three percent and ninety four point nine five percent, while a fast model optimized for thirty to forty second recordings achieved mean and median accuracies of eighty eight point eight six percent and ninety two point nine eight percent. These results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting clinically relevant cardiac information from opportunistic smartphone recordings, supporting scalable preliminary assessment and telehealth applications in veterinary cardiology."}

Recent neural networks can learn radio frequency~(RF) signal propagation patterns, but they process each voxel on the ray independently, without considering global context or environmental factors. Our paper presents a new approach that learns comprehensive representations of complete rays rather than individual points, capturing more detailed environmental features. We integrate a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) architecture with transformer modules to achieve better performance across realistic and synthetic scenes while maintaining computational efficiency. Our experimental results show that this approach outperforms existing methods in various scenarios. Ablation studies confirm that each component of our model contributes to its effectiveness. Additional experiments provide clear explanations for our model's performance."}

Baek"], "title": "Size is Not the Solution: Deformable Convolutions for Effective Physics Aware Deep Learning", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) enables rapid prediction of complex physical systems, yet current convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures struggle with highly nonlinear flows. While scaling model size addresses complexity in broader AI, this approach yields diminishing returns for physics modeling. Drawing inspiration from Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian (HLE) numerical methods, we introduce deformable physics-aware recurrent convolutions (D-PARC) to overcome the rigidity of CNNs. Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

This paper proposes a Resilient Hierarchical Power Control (RHPC) strategy to unify these conflicting requirements within a cohesive framework. A standardized power increment mechanism is developed to bridge the tertiary and secondary layers, ensuring that real-time load fluctuations are compensated strictly according to the optimal economic ratios derived from the tertiary layer. To address the strict active power saturation constraints of GFL units, a dynamic activation scheme coupled with projection operators is introduced, which actively isolates saturated nodes from the consensus loop to prevent integrator wind-up and preserve the stability of the GFM backbone. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates a multi-scale attention mechanism and LSTM-based predictors into the secondary control protocol, endowing the system with robustness against unbounded False Data Injection (FDI) attacks and packet losses. Rigorous theoretical analysis confirms that the system achieves Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB) convergence, and simulations on a modified IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves power sharing accuracy and operational resilience in both grid-connected and islanded modes compared to conventional methods."}

This work introduces a hierarchical self-evolving multi-agent framework that integrates a Base LLM, an operational SLM agent, a Code-Generation LLM, and a Teacher-LLM to enable continuous adaptation. The workflow begins with the agent attempting a task using reasoning and existing tools; if unsuccessful, it escalates to tool synthesis through the Code-Gen LLM, and when failures persist, it triggers an evolution phase using Curriculum Learning (CL), Reward-Based Learning (RL), or Genetic Algorithm (GA) evolution. Using the TaskCraft dataset rich in hierarchical tasks, tool-use traces, and difficulty scaling we evaluate these paradigms. CL delivers fast recovery and strong generalization, RL excels on high-difficulty tasks, and GA offers high behavioral diversity. Across all settings, evolved agents outperform their originals, demonstrating robust, autonomous, self-improving agentic evolution."}

Built on the strong two-stage Vevo baseline, S$^2$Voice advances style control and robustness through several contributions. First, we integrate style embeddings into the autoregressive large language model (AR LLM) via a FiLM-style layer-norm conditioning and a style-aware cross-attention for enhanced fine-grained style modeling. Second, we introduce a global speaker embedding into the flow-matching transformer to improve timbre similarity. Third, we curate a large, high-quality singing corpus via an automated pipeline for web harvesting, vocal separation, and transcript refinement. Finally, we employ a multi-stage training strategy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). Subjective listening tests confirm our system's superior performance: leading in style similarity and singer similarity for Task 1, and across naturalness, style similarity, and singer similarity for Task 2. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions in enhancing style fidelity, timbre preservation, and generalization.

Recent research has demonstrated that the reduced computational complexity of deep learning (DL)-based signal detection (SD) methods constitutes a compelling alternative to conventional techniques. In this study, low-complexity DL-based SD methods are proposed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS system and examined under Nakagami-$m$ channel conditions. The symbols obtained from the receiver antennas are combined using maximum ratio combining (MRC) and detected with the help of a DL-based detector implemented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and residual network (ResNet). Complexity analysis reveals that the MLP architecture offers significantly lower computational complexity compared to CNN, ResNet, and classical methods such as maximum likelihood detection (MLD). Furthermore, numerical analyses have shown that the proposed DL-based detectors, despite their low complexity, achieve comparable bit error rate (BER) performance to that of a high-performance MLD under various system conditions."}

While U-Net offers a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency compared to large transformer-based models, achieving real-time performance on high-resolution input remains challenging due to compute, memory, and power limits. Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs.\n  We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency.\n  To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs. Across 3 segmentation benchmarks, MBU-Net attains near full-precision accuracy (3% average drop) while delivering 2.04x speedup and 3.54x energy reductions over a 16-bit floating point U-Net."}

In dense IoT scenarios, synchronization may be disrupted either by the movement of nodes away from base stations or by the unavailability of reliable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which can be affected by physical obstructions, multipath fading, or environmental interference, such as such as walls, buildings, moving objects, or electromagnetic noise from surrounding devices. In such contexts, distributed synchronization through Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution, as it enables simultaneous transmission to multiple users with different power levels, supporting efficient synchronization while minimizing the signaling overhead. Moreover, NOMA also plays a vital role for dynamic priority management in dense and heterogeneous IoT environments. In this article, we proposed a Two-Stage NOMA-Enabled Framework \"TSN-IoT\" that integrates the mechanisms of conventional Precision Time Protocol (PTP) based synchronization, distributed synchronization and data transmission. The framework is designed as a four-tier architecture that facilitates prioritized data delivery from sensor nodes to the central base station. We demonstrated the performance of \"TSN-IoT\" through a healthcare use case, where intermittent connectivity and varying data priority levels present key challenges for reliable communication. Synchronization speed and end-to-end delay were evaluated through a series of simulations implemented in Python. Results show that, compared to priority-based Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), TSN-IoT achieves significantly better performance by offering improved synchronization opportunities and enabling parallel transmissions over the same sub-carrier."}

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces."}

Task-oriented communication supports agentic AI by transmitting only the task-related information instead of full raw data in order to reduce the bandwidth requirement. In real-world scenarios, AI agents often need to perform a sequence of actions to complete complex tasks. Completing these long-horizon tasks requires a hierarchical agentic AI architecture, where a high-level planner module decomposes a task into subtasks, and a low-level actor module executes each subtask sequentially. Since each subtask has a distinct goal, the existing task-oriented communication schemes are not designed to handle different goals for different subtasks. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a hierarchical task-oriented communication (HiTOC) framework. We consider a system with an edge server and a robot as an edge device. The high-level planner and low-level actor modules reside on the edge server. The robot transmits only the environment information that is relevant to the current subtask in order to complete a long-horizon task. We propose a conditional variational information bottleneck (cVIB) approach to train the HiTOC framework to adaptively transmit minimal information required for each subtask. Simulations conducted on the AI2-THOR platform demonstrate that the proposed HiTOC framework outperforms three state-of-the-art schemes in terms of the success rate on MAP-THOR benchmark."}

This paper presents a purpose-built lightweight object detection model designed to identify young pedestrians in various environmental scenarios. To address these challenges, our approach leverages thermal imaging from long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras, which enhances detection reliability in conditions where traditional RGB cameras operating in the visible spectrum fail. Based on the YOLO11 architecture and customized for thermal detection, our model, termed LTV-YOLO (Lightweight Thermal Vision YOLO), is optimized for computational efficiency, accuracy and real-time performance on edge devices. By integrating separable convolutions in depth and a feature pyramid network (FPN), LTV-YOLO achieves strong performance in detecting small-scale, partially occluded, and thermally distinct VRUs while maintaining a compact architecture. This work contributes a practical and scalable solution to improve pedestrian safety in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in school zones, autonomous navigation, and smart city infrastructure. Unlike prior thermal detectors, our contribution is task-specific: a thermally only edge-capable design designed for young and small VRUs (children and distant adults). Although FPN and depthwise separable convolutions are standard components, their integration into a thermal-only pipeline optimized for short/occluded VRUs under adverse conditions is, to the best of our knowledge, novel."}

Taking the Kuramoto model with inertia as the research carrier, the analytical expression of the time-varying inertia coefficient M(t) is strictly derived by the functional variational method, and a hierarchical control structure of \"benchmark inertia + disturbance feedback\" is constructed to achieve the organic unity of minimizing the vulnerability performance function H(T) and stability constraints. A multimodal decoupling control strategy based on Laplacian eigenvector projection is designed to enhance the feedback strength of the dominant mode by eigenvalue weighting, improving the control accuracy and dynamic response speed. Simulation verification is carried out in complex network systems, and the control performance of regular networks (RG), random networks (ER), small-world networks (SW), scale-free networks (SF) and spider webs (SP) under three typical disturbances of pulses, monotonic decays and oscillatory decays is systematically analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy reduces H(T) of the five networks by 19%-25%, shortens the relaxation time by 15%-24%, and the real parts of all system eigenvalues are less than -0.25s^-1 , meeting the asymptotic stability criterion. This study provides a new theoretical framework and engineering implementation scheme for the stability control of complex network synchronization systems, which can be widely applied to fields such as power grids, communication networks, and neural networks."}

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity."}

Both are analyzed in terms of boundedness and passivity, revealing that these properties are satisfied for any physically meaningful parametrization.

Meanwhile, machine learning inference workloads increasingly migrate to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms for their scalability and cost-efficiency [2], [3], [4]. However, this convergence introduces critical security challenges, with recent reports showing a 220% increase in AI/ML vulnerabilities [5] and serverless computing's fragmented architecture raises new security concerns distinct from traditional cloud deployments [6], [7]. This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of machine learning workloads in serverless environments. We systematically characterize the attack surface across five categories: function-level vulnerabilities (cold start exploitation, dependency poisoning), model-specific threats (API-based extraction, adversarial inputs), infrastructure attacks (cross-function contamination, privilege escalation), supply chain risks (malicious layers, backdoored libraries), and IAM complexity (ephemeral nature, serverless functions). Through empirical assessments across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, we demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and quantify their security impact. We propose Serverless AI Shield (SAS), a multi-layered defense framework providing pre-deployment validation, runtime monitoring, and post-execution forensics. Our evaluation shows SAS achieves 94% detection rates while maintaining performance overhead below 9% for inference latency. We release an open-source security toolkit to enable practitioners to assess and harden their serverless AI deployments, advancing the field toward more resilient cloud-native machine learning systems."}

The model incorporates key constraints including BS operational state, user equipment (UE)-BS connection relationship, and load threshold, laying a theoretical foundation for the coordinated optimization of energy conservation and quality of service. Based on this model, an integrated solution combining UE-BS initial connection optimization and load-sharing based BS sleeping is proposed. In the initial connection phase, with communication quality and BS load as dual constraints, efficient matching between UEs and optimal BSs is achieved through three sequential steps: communication feasibility screening, redundant connection removal, and overload load redistribution. This resolves the problems of load imbalance and difficult identification of redundant BSs in UDNs arising from unordered initial connections. In the BS sleeping phase, a BS sleeping index, comprehensively considering UE transferability and backup BS resources, is innovatively introduced to quantify BS dormancy priority. Through a closed-loop process involving low-load BS screening, adjacent BS load evaluation, and load sharing by two takeover BSs based on their capacity, accurate dormancy of redundant BSs and collaborative load migration are realized. Simulation results in a typical UDNs scenario demonstrate that, compared with the traditional baseline scheme, the proposed solution exhibits significant advantages in convergence speed, optimization of the number of active BSs, and EE improvement."}

Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol. Extensive empirical results validate the superior performance of our proposed method across multiple few-shot classification tasks."}

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

In this paper, we introduce MetamerGen, a tool for generating scenes that are aligned with latent human scene representations. MetamerGen is a latent diffusion model that combines peripherally obtained scene gist information with information obtained from scene-viewing fixations to generate image metamers for what humans understand after viewing a scene. Generating images from both high and low resolution (i.e. \"foveated\") inputs constitutes a novel image-to-image synthesis problem, which we tackle by introducing a dual-stream representation of the foveated scenes consisting of DINOv2 tokens that fuse detailed features from fixated areas with peripherally degraded features capturing scene context. To evaluate the perceptual alignment of MetamerGen generated images to latent human scene representations, we conducted a same-different behavioral experiment where participants were asked for a \"same\" or \"different\" response between the generated and the original image. With that, we identify scene generations that are indeed metamers for the latent scene representations formed by the viewers. MetamerGen is a powerful tool for understanding scene understanding. Our proof-of-concept analyses uncovered specific features at multiple levels of visual processing that contributed to human judgments. While it can generate metamers even conditioned on random fixations, we find that high-level semantic alignment most strongly predicts metamerism when the generated scenes are conditioned on viewers' own fixated regions."}

We introduce CLMU-Net, a replay-based CL framework for 3D brain lesion segmentation that supports arbitrary and variable modality combinations without requiring prior knowledge of the maximum set. A conceptually simple yet effective channel-inflation strategy maps any modality subset into a unified multi-channel representation, enabling a single model to operate across diverse datasets. To enrich inherently local 3D patch features, we incorporate lightweight domain-conditioned textual embeddings that provide global modality-disease context for each training case. Forgetting is further reduced through principled replay using a compact buffer composed of both prototypical and challenging samples. Experiments on five heterogeneous MRI brain datasets demonstrate that CLMU-Net consistently outperforms popular CL baselines.

However, it is critically challenged by the resource constraints of a single edge node. Distributed inference has emerged to aggregate and leverage computational resources across multiple devices. Yet, existing methods typically require strict synchronization, which is often infeasible due to the unreliable network conditions. In this paper, we propose HALO, a novel framework that can boost the distributed LLM inference in lossy edge network. The core idea is to enable a relaxed yet effective synchronization by strategically allocating less critical neuron groups to unstable devices, thus avoiding the excessive waiting time incurred by delayed packets. HALO introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a semantic-aware predictor to assess the significance of neuron groups prior to activation. (2) a parallel execution scheme of neuron group loading during the model inference. (3) a load-balancing scheduler that efficiently orchestrates multiple devices with heterogeneous resources. Experimental results from a Raspberry Pi cluster demonstrate that HALO achieves a 3.41x end-to-end speedup for LLaMA-series LLMs under unreliable network conditions. It maintains performance comparable to optimal conditions and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in various scenarios."}

We first derive closed-form expressions for the system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) as functions of the power allocation coefficients and the number of active antennas at the access points (APs). Then, we aim to enhance the EE through jointly optimizing antenna activation and power control. This task leads to a non-convex and mixed-integer design problem with high-dimensional design variables. To address this, we propose a novel DRL-based framework, in which the agent learns to map large-scale fading coefficients to AP activation ratio, antenna coefficient, and power coefficient. These coefficients are then employed to determine the number of active antennas per AP and the power factors assigned to users based on closed-form expressions. By optimizing these parameters instead of directly controlling antenna selection and power allocation, the proposed method transforms the intractable optimization into a low-dimensional learning task. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme. Specifically, in a CFmMIMO system with 40 APs and 20 users, it achieves a 50% EE improvement and 3350 times run time reduction compared to the conventional sequential convex approximation method."}

The remaining design freedom is thereby reduced to a four-parameter optimization problem, which we solve by particle swarm optimization. Numerical experiments show that the resulting two-level procedure consistently decreases the Dirichlet energy and, in our tests, often reduces the realized surface area relative to classical Bernstein--Bézier Dirichlet patches and representative quasi-harmonic and bending-energy constructions under identical boundary control data.

In particular, we focus on how the position of such a payload relative to the vehicle's Center of Gravity (CoG) affects the stability and control performance at an arbitrary point of interest on the UAV, such as the payload position, and on how this position can be optimized. Our conclusions are based on two key contributions. First, we analyze the stability of the zero-dynamics of a complete nonlinear model of the UAV with payload. We demonstrate that the stability of the zero dynamics depends on the vertical signed distance in the body-fixed frame between the controlled output position and the combined CoG of the UAV with payload. Specifically, positioning the output below the CoG yields unstable zero dynamics, while the linearized zero dynamics are marginally stable when placing it above, indicating reduced sensitivity to input disturbances. Second, we analyze the performance of the linearized UAV model with payload by providing an analytical expression for the H2-norm, from which we can quantify the system's attenuation to white noise input disturbances. We conclude that less control authority leads to a higher optimal position of the controlled output with respect to the CoG for closed-loop white-noise disturbance rejection capabilities, also when the heavy payload is the controlled output.

This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \\textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage.

This fundamentally restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable. This paper presents SHARE (Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration with Equivariance), a fully unsupervised framework that unifies geometric equivariance principles with low-rank spectral modelling to eliminate the need for ground truth. SHARE's core concept is to exploit the intrinsic invariance of hyperspectral structures under differentiable geometric transformations (e.g. rotations and scaling) to derive self-supervision signals through equivariance consistency constraints. Our novel Dynamic Adaptive Spectral Attention (DASA) module further enhances this paradigm shift by explicitly encoding the global low-rank property of HSI and adaptively refining local spectral-spatial correlations through learnable attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on HSI inpainting and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SHARE. Our method outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to that of supervised methods. We hope that our approach will shed new light on HSI restoration and broader scientific imaging scenarios. The code will be released at https://github.com/xuwayyy/SHARE."}

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE TSP", "summary": "Diversity is an essential concept associated with communication reliability in multipath channels since it determines the slope of bit error rate performance in the medium to high signal-to-noise ratio regions. However, most of the existing analytical frameworks were developed for specific modulation schemes while the efficient validation of full multipath diversity for general modulation schemes remains an open problem. To fill this research gap, we propose to utilize random constellation rotation to ease the conditions for full-diversity modulation designs. For linearly precoded cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, we prove that maximum multipath diversity can be attained as long as the spread matrix does not have zero entries, which is a sufficient but easily satisfied condition. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for general modulation schemes, whose verification can be divided into validation tasks for each column of the modulation matrix. Based on the proposed conditions, maximum diversity order can be attained with the probability of 1 by enabling a randomly generated rotation pattern for both time and doubly dispersive channels. The theoretical analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the diversity evaluation can be concentrated on the pairwise error probability when the number of error symbols is one, which reduces the complexity of diversity-driven design and performance analysis for novel modulation schemes significantly in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Finally, numerical results for various modulation schemes confirm that the theoretical analysis holds in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, when employing practical detectors, the random constellation rotation technique consistently enhance the transmission reliability for both coded and uncoded systems."}

We propose Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding (DAME), a model-agnostic framework that builds a nested hierarchy of sub-embeddings aligned to utterance durations: lower-dimensional representations capture compact speaker traits from short utterances, while higher dimensions encode richer details from longer speech. DAME supports both training from scratch and fine-tuning, and serves as a direct alternative to conventional large-margin fine-tuning, consistently improving performance across durations. On the VoxCeleb1-O/E/H and VOiCES evaluation sets, DAME consistently reduces the equal error rate on 1-s and other short-duration trials, while maintaining full-length performance with no additional inference cost.

We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%.

Method: We conducted a Rapid Review with snowballing to select the appropriate peer-reviewed studies. We leveraged the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Springer as our primary source databases. Results: Technical lag accumulates passively, often unnoticed due to inadequate detection metrics and tools. It negatively impacts software quality through outdated dependencies, obsolete APIs, unsupported platforms, and aging infrastructure. Strategies to manage technical lag primarily involve automated dependency updates, continuous integration processes, and regular auditing. Conclusions: Enhancing and extending the current standardized metrics, detection methods, and empirical studies to use technical lag as an indication of accumulated latent debt can greatly improve the process of maintaining large codebases that are heavily dependent on external packages. We have identified the research gaps and outlined a future vision for researchers and practitioners to explore."}

Our measurements indicate that these timing variations stem from the micro-op cache placement and the jump's offset in the L1 instruction cache of modern processors. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent across multiple microarchitectures, including Skylake, Coffee Lake, and Kaby Lake, as well as various real-world implementations. We confirm the prevalence of this variability through extensive experiments on a large-scale set of popular binaries, including libraries from Ubuntu 24.04, Windows 10 Pro, and several open-source cryptographic libraries. We also show that one can easily avoid this timing variability by ensuring that macro-fusible instructions are 32-byte aligned - an approach initially suggested in 2019 by Intel in an overlooked short report. We quantify the performance impact of this approach across the cryptographic libraries, showing a speedup of 2.15% on average (and up to 10.54%) when avoiding the timing variability. As a by-product, we show that this variability can be exploited as a covert channel, achieving a maximum throughput of 16.14 Mbps."}

Concurrently, the batch least-squares identification (BaLSI) method is employed to identify other unknown parameters in the input channel. Using control barrier functions (CBFs) and backstepping, we first develop a full-state safe controller. Based on this, we build an output-feedback controller by performing system identification using only the output data and actuation signals as well as constructing an observer to estimate the unmeasured plant states. The proposed approach achieves: 1) finite-time identification of a substantial set of unknown system quantities, and 2) exponential convergence of the output state (the state furthest from the control input) to a reference trajectory while rigorously ensuring safety constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a safe vehicle platooning application."}

To address this challenge, we propose a burst aware forecasting solution. This challenge may arise in a wide range of wireless networks; therefore, the proposed solution is broadly applicable to settings characterized by bursty traffic patterns where accurate demand forecasting is essential. Our approach introduces three key enhancements to a transformer architecture: (i) a distance from the last burst embedding to capture burst proximity, (ii) two additional linear layers in the decoder to forecast both upcoming bursts and their relative impact, and (iii) use of an asymmetric cost function during model training to better capture burst dynamics. Empirical evaluations in an Earth-fixed cell under high-traffic demand scenario demonstrate that the proposed model reduces prediction error by up to 94% at a one-step horizon and maintains the ability to accurately capture bursts even near the end of longer prediction horizons following Mean Square Error (MSE) metric."}

In this paper, we propose LRC-DHVC, a hierarchical video compression network, which allows continuous local rate control on a pixel level to vary the spatial quality distribution within individual video frames. This is achieved by concatenating a quality map to the input frame and applying a weighted MSE loss which matches the pixelwise trade-off factors in the quality map. During training, the model sees a variety of quality maps due to a constrained-random generation. Our model is the first neural video compression network, which can continuously and spatially adapt to varying quality constraints.

We then apply contrastive preference optimization to favor questions supported by retrieved passages over ungrounded alternatives. Evaluated on four benchmarks, RAC demonstrate significant improvements over baselines. In addition to LLM-as-Judge assessments, we introduce novel metrics derived from NLI and data-to-text to assess how well questions are anchored in the context, and we demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances faithfulness."}

However, practical systems suffer from frequency-dependent and (spatial) antenna-dependent phase offsets, degrading localization accuracy. This paper analytically studies the impact of phase incoherence on localization performance under a static User Equipment (UE) and Line-of-Sight (LoS) scenario. We use two complementary tools. First, we derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to quantify the theoretical limits under phase offsets. Then, we develop a Spatial Ambiguity Function (SAF)-based model to characterize ambiguity patterns. Simulation results reveal that spatial phase offsets severely degrade localization performance, while frequency phase offsets have a minor effect in the considered system configuration. To address this, we propose a robust Channel State Information (CSI) calibration framework and validate it using real-world measurements from a practical massive MIMO testbed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed calibration framework significantly improves the localization Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) from 5 m to 1.2 cm, aligning well with the theoretical predictions."}

A traditional fermentation tank is equipped with a piezoelectric transducer able to irradiate the tank with ultrasonic waves, providing an external abiotic stimulus to enhance the growth of yeast and accelerate the fermentation process. At its core, the digital twin incorporates a predictive model that estimates yeast's culture density over time based on the surrounding environmental conditions. To this end, we implement, tailor and extend the model proposed in Palacios et al., allowing us to effectively handle the limited number of available training samples by using temperature, ultrasonic frequency, and duty cycle as inputs. The results obtained along with the assessment of model performance demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach."}

We propose a novel approach to the SSDG problem by aligning the intermediate features of our model with the semantically rich and generalized feature space of a Vision Language Model (VLM) in a way that promotes domain-invariance. The above approach is enhanced with effective image-level augmentation and output-level regularization strategies to improve data utilization and minimize overfitting. Extensive experimentation across four benchmarks against existing SSDG baselines suggests that our method achieves SOTA results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

As a result, recent work incorporates some 3D tasks (such as depth estimation) into VFM training. However, VFM performance remains inconsistent across other spatial tasks, raising the question of whether these models truly have spatial awareness or overfit to specific 3D objectives. To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities. Through our analysis, we provide insights into the mechanisms that support or hinder spatial awareness in modern VFMs. We hope that SpaRRTa will serve as a useful tool for guiding the development of future spatially aware visual models."}

Nixie is a system service that coordinates GPU memory allocation and kernel launch behavior to efficiently utilize the CPU-GPU bi-directional bandwidth and CPU pinned memory. A lightweight scheduler in Nixie further improves responsiveness by automatically prioritizing latency-sensitive interactive jobs using MLFQ-inspired techniques. Our evaluations show that Nixie improves latency of real interactive code-completion tasks by up to $3.8\\times$ and saves up to 66.8% CPU pinned memory usage given the same latency requirement."}

A common approach for active orbit control involves the use of multiple thrusters, which, when properly arranged, can also generate the required torque for attitude control. Starting from a 24-thruster configuration, this paper presents a set of thruster configurations (referred to as a viable configuration group) that enable full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) control. Further, configuration group that requires minimum total thrust to achieve 6-DOF commands are found among the viable configuration group. One configuration from each of these groups is further evaluated for its attitude control performance through a representative rendezvous-docking mission, demonstrating that even with a reduced thruster count, sufficient maneuverability can be achieved."}

By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization. We provide analytical insights into the behavior of the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple domains, including prediction of responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data and high-content microscopy-based drug screening tasks.

These heuristic perturbations frequently generate semantically invalid, out-of-distribution inputs that weaken the fidelity of local surrogate models. While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict \"Single Mask-Single Sample\" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth. Empirical results demonstrate that LIME-LLM establishes a new benchmark for black-box NLP explainability, achieving significant improvements in local explanation fidelity compared to both traditional perturbation-based methods and recent generative alternatives."}

When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the method for both individual and multi-UAV scenarios with multiple formation geometries encountering moving obstacles. The proposed approach achieves safe, smooth, and computationally efficient avoidance maneuvers suitable for real-time and practical applications."}

We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment. User studies further validate these results, showing that PRISM is consistently preferred by designers."}

The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks.

The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases.

Radar suits this role by sensing motion through occlusions and in darkness. Modern deep-learning pipelines are the standard for interpreting radar returns effectively; however, they are often parameter-heavy and sensitive at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), motivating compact alternatives like Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs). A two-qubit HQNN is benchmarked against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar measurements under matched training protocols. In clean conditions, the HQNN achieves high accuracy (99.7% synthetic; 97.0% real) with up to 170x fewer parameters (0.066M). Its parameter efficiency is shown to be structural, as an ablation of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) causes sharp performance drops on real data (to 68.5% and 31.5% for the control heads). A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements. In label-fraction ablations, CNNs prove more sample-efficient on real Range-Doppler Maps (RDMs), with the performance gap being most pronounced (at 50% labels, BA 0.89-0.99 vs. HQNN 0.75). On synthetic data, this gap narrows significantly, largely vanishing by the 50% label mark. Overall, the HQNN's value lies in parameter efficiency and a compact inductive bias that shapes its distinct sensitivity profile; this work establishes a rigorous baseline for hybrid quantum models in privacy-preserving radar occupancy sensing."}

Social media language provides an opportunity for scalable detection, but current models often lack interpretability, keyword-robustness validation, and rigorous user-level data integrity. This work presents a transparent approach to social media-based anxiety detection through linguistically interpretable feature-grounded modeling and cross-domain validation. Using a substantial dataset of Reddit posts, we trained a logistic regression classifier on carefully curated subreddits for training, validation, and test splits. Comprehensive evaluation included feature ablation, keyword masking experiments, and varying-density difference analyses comparing anxious and control groups, along with external validation using clinically interviewed participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders. The model achieved strong performance while maintaining high accuracy even after sentiment removal or keyword masking. Early detection using minimal post history significantly outperformed random classification, and cross-domain analysis demonstrated strong consistency with clinical interview data. Results indicate that transparent linguistic features can support reliable, generalizable, and keyword-robust anxiety detection. The proposed framework provides a reproducible baseline for interpretable mental health screening across diverse online contexts."}

By integrating optical music recognition and automatic music transcription modules, MuseAgent enables multi-step reasoning and interaction over fine-grained musical content. To systematically evaluate music understanding capabilities, we further propose MuseBench, a benchmark covering music theory reasoning, score interpretation, and performance-level analysis across text, image, and audio modalities. Experiments show that existing MLLMs perform poorly on these tasks, while MuseAgent achieves substantial improvements, highlighting the importance of structured multimodal grounding for interactive music understanding."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks."}

While existing solutions provably reduce the sum estimation task to acquiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ most similar vectors, where $n$ is the number of objects, we introduce a novel algorithm that only requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$ most similar vectors.

With the top-$k$ objects from each level, we propose an unbiased estimate of the sum and prove a high-probability relative error bound. We run experiments on OpenImages and Amazon Reviews with a vector similar search implementation to show that our method can achieve lower error using less computational time than existing reductions. We show results on applications in estimating densities, computing softmax denominators, and counting the number of vectors within a ball."}

To address these challenges, we designed a multimodal system combining AR visuals with a custom wrist-worn haptic device delivering directional and state-based cues. A formative study with experienced surgeons and residents identified key tool maneuvers and preferences for reference mappings, guiding our cue design. In a cue identification experiment (N=21), participants accurately recognized five vibration patterns under visual load, with higher recognition for full-actuator states than spatial direction cues. In a guidance task (N=27), participants using both AR and haptics achieved significantly higher spatial precision (5.8 mm) and usability (SUS = 88.1) than those using either modality alone, despite having modest increases in task time. Participants reported that haptic cues provided reassuring confirmation and reduced cognitive effort during alignment. Our results highlight the promise of integrating wrist-based haptics into AR systems for high-precision, visually complex tasks such as surgical guidance. We discuss design implications for multimodal interfaces supporting confident, efficient tool manipulation."}

While these approaches raise the bar against attacks, they incur substantial overhead, much of which arises not from genuine functional reconfigurability need, but from artificial complexity intended solely to frustrate reverse engineering (RE). As a result, fabrics are often underutilized, and security is achieved at disproportionate cost. This paper introduces NuRedact, the first full-custom eFPGA redaction framework that embraces architectural non-uniformity to balance security and efficiency. Built as an extension of the widely adopted OpenFPGA infrastructure, NuRedact introduces a three-stage methodology: (i) custom fabric generation with pin-mapping irregularity, (ii) VPR-level modifications to enable non-uniform placement guided by an automated Python-based optimizer, and (iii) redaction-aware reconfiguration and mapping of target IP modules. Experimental results show up to 9x area reduction compared to conventional uniform fabrics, achieving competitive efficiency with LUT-based and even transistor-level redaction techniques while retaining strong resilience. From a security perspective, NuRedact fabrics are evaluated against state-of-the-art attack models, including SAT-based, cyclic, and sequential variants, and show enhanced resilience while maintaining practical design overheads."}

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NAC performance on both signal reconstruction quality and downstream applications using 11 metrics.

In this paper, we conduct a numerical study of the variational (Galerkin) and collocation formulations for these linearized networks. Our numerical results reveal that, in the variational formulation, the associated linear systems are severely ill-conditioned, forming the primary computational bottleneck in scaling the neural network size, even when direct solvers are employed. In contrast, collocation methods combined with robust least-squares solvers exhibit better numerical stability and achieve higher accuracy as we increase neuron numbers. This behavior is consistently observed for both ReLU$^k$ and $\\tanh$ activations, with $\\tanh$ networks exhibiting even worse conditioning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that random sampling of the hidden layer parameters, commonly used in RFM and ELM, is not necessary for achieving high accuracy. For ReLU$^k$ activations, this follows from existing theory and is verified numerically in this paper, while for $\\tanh$ activations, we introduce two deterministic schemes that achieve comparable accuracy."}

In this paper, we introduce a fully self-reflective detoxification framework that harnesses the inherent capacities of LLMs to detect, correct toxic content, and refine LLMs without external modules and data annotation. Specifically, we propose a Toxic Signal Detector --an internal self-identification mechanism, coupled with a systematic intervention process to transform toxic text into its non-toxic counterpart. This iterative procedure yields a contrastive detoxification dataset used to fine-tune the model, enhancing its ability for safe and coherent text generation. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as DetoxLLM and ParaDetox show that our method achieves better detoxification performance than state-of-the-art methods while preserving semantic fidelity. By obviating the need for human intervention or external components, this paper reveals the intrinsic self-detoxification ability of LLMs, offering a consistent and effective approach for mitigating harmful content generation.

To address this issue, we propose a non-intrusive method for filtering hallucination errors from discrete token-based GSE models. Our method leverages the log-probabilities of generated tokens as confidence scores to detect potential errors. Experimental results show that the confidence scores strongly correlate with a suite of intrusive SE metrics, and that our method effectively identifies hallucination errors missed by conventional filtering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method: curating an in-the-wild TTS dataset with our confidence-based filtering improves the performance of subsequently trained TTS models."}

Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models.

We evaluate the validity of a simpler alternative: can translation quality alone indicate a model's broader multilingual capabilities? Through systematic evaluation of 14 models (1B-72B parameters) across 9 diverse benchmarks and 7 translation metrics, we find that translation performance is a good indicator of downstream task success (e.g., Phi-4, median Pearson r: MetricX = 0.89, xCOMET = 0.91, SSA-COMET = 0.87).

When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered.

We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances.

While Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-Judge approaches offer scalability, their reliability in evaluating adherence of different types of system instructions remains unverified. This study asks: To what extent does the instruction type of an Application Under Test (AUT) influence the stability of judge evaluations? To address this, we introduce the Scoped Instruction Decomposition Framework to classify AUT instructions into Objective and Subjective types, isolating the factors that drive judge instability. We applied this framework to two representative HR GenAI applications, evaluating the stability of four judge architectures over variable runs. Our results reveal a ``Stability Trap'' characterized by a divergence between Verdict Stability and Reasoning Stability. While judges achieved near-perfect verdict agreement ($>99\\%$) for both objective and subjective evaluations, their accompanying justification traces diverged significantly. Objective instructions requiring quantitative analysis, such as word counting, exhibited reasoning stability as low as $\\approx19\\%$, driven by variances in numeric justifications. Similarly, reasoning stability for subjective instructions varied widely ($35\\%$--$83\\%$) based on evidence granularity, with feature-specific checks failing to reproduce consistent rationale. Conversely, objective instructions focusing on discrete entity extraction achieved high reasoning stability ($>90\\%$). These findings demonstrate that high verdict stability can mask fragile reasoning. Thus, we suggest that auditors scope automated evaluation protocols strictly: delegate all deterministically verifiable logic to code, while reserving LLM judges for complex semantic evaluation."}

Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has emerged as a key technique for generalisable emotion recognition. However, as conventional CLAP enforces a strict one-to-one alignment between paired audio-text samples, it overlooks intra-modal similarity and treats all non-matching pairs as equally negative. This conflicts with the fuzzy boundaries between different emotions. To address this limitation, we propose SmoothCLAP, which introduces softened targets derived from intra-modal similarity and paralinguistic features. By combining these softened targets with conventional contrastive supervision, SmoothCLAP learns embeddings that respect graded emotional relationships, while retaining the same inference pipeline as CLAP. Experiments on eight affective computing tasks across English and German demonstrate that SmoothCLAP is consistently achieving superior performance. Our results highlight that leveraging soft supervision is a promising strategy for building emotion-aware audio-text models."}

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $η_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($η_t < η_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($η_t > η_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment."}

We applied several attribution methods, including error maps, saliency maps, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, GradSHAP, and Grad-CAM. Although MAE shows a slightly lower detection, it consistently provides more faithful and temporally precise explanations, suggesting a better alignment with true anomalies. To assess the relevance of the regions highlighted by the explanation method, we propose a perturbation-based faithfulness metric that replaces them with their reconstructions to simulate normal input. Our findings, based on experiments in a real industrial scenario, highlight the importance of incorporating interpretability into anomaly detection pipelines and show that masked training improves explanation quality without compromising performance."}

However, NTP operates at the \\textit{token} level, treating deviations from a single reference continuation as errors even when alternative continuations are equally plausible or semantically equivalent (e.g., ``mom'' vs. ``mother''). As a result, token-level loss can penalize valid abstractions, paraphrases, or conceptually correct reasoning paths, biasing models toward surface form rather than underlying meaning. This mismatch between the training signal and semantic correctness motivates learning objectives that operate over higher-level representations. We propose a shift from token-level to concept-level prediction, where concepts group multiple surface forms of the same idea (e.g., ``mom,'' ``mommy,'' ``mother'' $\\rightarrow$ \\textit{MOTHER}). We introduce various methods for integrating conceptual supervision into LLM training and show that concept-aware models achieve lower perplexity, improved robustness under domain shift, and stronger performance than NTP-based models on diverse NLP benchmarks.

In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome.

The majority of current methods are rule-based, requiring the specification of a grammar or a set of primitive components and modules that can be composed to create a design. We propose a novel automated robot design framework, RobotDesignGPT, that leverages the general knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained vision-language models to automate the robot design synthesis process. Our framework synthesizes an initial robot design from a simple user prompt and a reference image. Our novel visual feedback approach allows us to greatly improve the design quality and reduce unnecessary manual feedback. We demonstrate that our framework can design visually appealing and kinematically valid robots inspired by nature, ranging from legged animals to flying creatures. We justify the proposed framework by conducting an ablation study and a user study."}

While related to speech separation, MSVS faces unique challenges: data scarcity and the highly correlated nature of singing voices mixture. To address these issues, we propose UNMIXX with three key components: (1) musically informed mixing strategy to construct highly correlated, music-like mixtures, (2) cross-source attention that drives representations of two singers apart via reverse attention, and (3) magnitude penalty loss penalizing erroneously assigned interfering energy. UNMIXX not only addresses data scarcity by simulating realistic training data, but also excels at separating highly correlated mixtures through cross-source interactions at both the architectural and loss levels. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UNMIXX greatly enhances performance, with SDRi gains exceeding 2.2 dB over prior work."}

This study compares three rendering strategies: a Platform-Only baseline that renders the total interaction force; a Hybrid A (Position + Force Feedback) strategy that adds a dynamic, real-time soft spatial cue; and a Hybrid B (Position + Preloaded Stiffness Feedback) strategy that provides a constant, pre-calculated soft spatial cue.\n  In a 12-participant lump detection study, both hybrid methods dramatically improved accuracy over the Platform-Only baseline (from 50\\% to over 95\\%).

To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances.

While the GPU-accelerated Inverted File (IVF) index acts as one of the most widely used techniques for these large-scale workloads due to its memory efficiency, its traditional architecture remains fundamentally static. Existing designs rely on rigid and contiguous memory layouts that lack native support for in-place mutation, creating a severe bottleneck for streaming scenarios. In applications requiring real-time knowledge updates, such as live recommendation engines or dynamic RAG systems, maintaining index freshness necessitates expensive CPU-GPU roundtrips that cause system latency to spike from milliseconds to seconds. In this paper, we propose SIVF (Streaming Inverted File), a new GPU-native architecture designed to empower vector databases with high-velocity data ingestion and deletion capabilities. SIVF replaces the static memory layout with a slab-based allocation system and a validity bitmap, enabling lock-free and in-place mutation directly in VRAM. We further introduce a GPU-resident address translation table (ATT) to resolve the overhead of locating vectors, providing $O(1)$ access to physical storage slots. We evaluate SIVF against the industry-standard GPU IVF implementation on the SIFT1M and GIST1M datasets. Microbenchmarks demonstrate that SIVF reduces deletion latency by up to $13,300\\times$ (from 11.8 seconds to 0.89 ms on GIST1M) and improves ingestion throughput by $36\\times$ to $105\\times$. In end-to-end sliding window scenarios, SIVF eliminates system freezes and achieves a $161\\times$ to $266\\times$ speedup with single-digit millisecond latency.

LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure.\n  We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon.\n  Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds. The resulting system indicates a plausible path toward persistent, autonomous operation for indoor and outdoor monitoring.

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models.

In this paper, we measured participants' task performance and eye movements while identifying the group with the largest number of internal edges. We investigated the effect of visualization elements on task performance while controlling the density of internal edges and the box size.

As a systems engineering approach, the successful implementation of HCAI depends critically on the design and optimization of high-quality human-AI interaction (HAII). This paper systematically reviews our research team's nearly decade-long exploration and practice in HCAI. At the level of research vision, we were among the first in China to systematically propose HAII as an interdisciplinary field and to develop a human-centered conceptual framework for human--AI collaboration. At the theoretical level, we introduced frameworks for human-AI joint cognitive systems, team-level situation awareness among intelligent agents, and shared social understanding, forming a relatively comprehensive theoretical system. At the methodological level, we established a hierarchical HCAI framework and a taxonomy of HCAI implementation methods. At the application level, we conducted a series of studies in domains such as autonomous driving, intelligent aircraft cockpit, and trust in human-AI collaboration, empirically validating the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks. Looking ahead, research on HCAI and HAII must continue to advance along three dimensions: theoretical deepening, methodological innovation, and application expansion, promoting the development of an intelligent society that is human-centered and characterized by harmonious human-AI coexistence."}

To analyze its asymptotic behavior, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP).

However, classical LiNGAM methods rely on the strong assumption that there exists an ordering under which the noise terms are exactly independent, an assumption that is often violated in the presence of confounding. In this paper, we propose a general information-theoretic framework for causal order estimation that remains applicable under arbitrary confounding. Rather than imposing independence as a hard constraint, we quantify the degree of confounding by the multivariate mutual information among the noise variables. This quantity is decomposed into a sum of mutual information terms along a causal order and is estimated using Bayesian marginal likelihoods. The resulting criterion can be interpreted as Bayesian ICA for causal discovery, where causal order selection is formulated as a model selection problem over permutations. Under standard regularity conditions, we show that the proposed Bayesian mutual information estimator is consistent, with redundancy of order $O(\\log n)$. To avoid non-identifiability caused by Gaussian noise, we employ non-Gaussian predictive models, including multivariate $t$ distributions, whose marginal likelihoods can be evaluated via MCMC. The proposed method recovers classical LiNGAM and DirectLiNGAM as limiting cases in the absence of confounding, while providing a principled ranking of causal orders when confounding is present. This establishes a unified, confounding-aware, and information-theoretically grounded extension of ICA-based causal discovery."}

Users are incessantly asked to \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out\" of data collection, forced to make defensive decisions whose consequences are increasingly difficult to predict.

However, as organizations increasingly use AI to make inferences, the rapid expansion of Blind Self, attributes known to algorithms but unknown to the user, emerges as a critical challenge. We illustrate how current regulations fall short because they focus on data collection rather than inference and leave this blind spot unguarded. Building on the theory of Contextual Integrity, we propose a paradigm shift from defensive privacy management to proactive privacy advocacy. We argue for the necessity of personal advocacy agents capable of operationalizing social norms to harness the power of AI inference. By illuminating the hidden inferences that users can strategically leverage or suppress, these agents not only restrain the growth of Blind Self but also mine it for value.

We propose a learning-free, physics-informed inpainting frontend based on reverse time migration (RTM). In this approach, observed multichannel spectrograms are first back-propagated on a 3D grid using an analytic Green's function to form a scene-consistent image, and then forward-projected to reconstruct inpainted signals before log-mel feature extraction and Transformer-based classification. We evaluate the method on ESC-50 with 50 sensors and three layouts (circular, linear, right-angle), where per-channel SNRs are sampled from -30 to 0 dB. Compared with an AST baseline, scaling-sparsemax channel selection, and channel-swap augmentation, the proposed RTM frontend achieves the best or competitive accuracy across all layouts, improving accuracy by 13.1 points on the right-angle layout (from 9.7% to 22.8%). Correlation analyses show that spatial weights align more strongly with SNR than with channel--source distance, and that higher SNR--weight correlation corresponds to higher SEC accuracy. These results demonstrate that a reconstruct-then-project, physics-based preprocessing effectively complements learning-only methods for DMAS under layout-open configurations and severe channel degradation."}

To address the limitations of these techniques, we propose RAPID-Serve: a technique to concurrently execute prefill and decode on the same GPU(s) to meet latency SLOs while maintaining high throughput and efficient resource utilization.

However, a critical limitation of existing approaches is their reliance on unconstrained global matching strategies. In open-world scenarios, trying to match anchor features against the entire query image space introduces excessive ambiguity, as target features are easily confused with background distractors. To resolve this, we propose Fine-grained Correspondence Pose Estimation (FiCoP), a framework that transitions from noise-prone global matching to spatially-constrained patch-level correspondence. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a patch-to-patch correlation matrix as a structural prior to narrowing the matching scope, effectively filtering out irrelevant clutter to prevent it from degrading pose estimation. Firstly, we introduce an object-centric disentanglement preprocessing to isolate the semantic target from environmental noise. Secondly, a Cross-Perspective Global Perception (CPGP) module is proposed to fuse dual-view features, establishing structural consensus through explicit context reasoning. Finally, we design a Patch Correlation Predictor (PCP) that generates a precise block-wise association map, acting as a spatial filter to enforce fine-grained, noise-resilient matching. Experiments on the REAL275 and Toyota-Light datasets demonstrate that FiCoP improves Average Recall by 8.0% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method, highlighting its capability to deliver robust and generalized perception for robotic agents operating in complex, unconstrained open-world environments.

This choice determines whether the second phase commences immediately or (potentially) after waiting in a queue for the single-service facility to become available.\n  The decision-making scenario is modeled via a Markov decision process formulation, of a clearing system with holding costs at each station.

Type-I servers are non-preemptive and cannot engage with new jobs until their current job is completed.\n  We provide a complete characterization of the structural properties of the optimal policy for the clearing system. In particular, an optimal control is shown to follow a threshold structure based on the number of jobs in the queue before a Type-I first interaction and on the number of jobs in either independent or collaborative service.\n  We propose simple threshold heuristics, based on linear approximations, for real-time decision-making. In much of the parameter and state spaces, we establish theoretical bounds that compare the thresholds proposed by our heuristics to those of optimal policies and identify parameter configurations where these bounds are attained. Outside of these regions, the optimal thresholds are infinite. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our heuristics, particularly when the initial queue length is high. Our proposed heuristics achieve costs within 0.5% of the optimal policy on average and significantly outperform benchmark policies that exhibit extreme sensitivity to system parameters, sometimes incurring costs exceeding 100% of the optimal."}

Motivated by practical constraints in sensor deployment, we show that global recovery of the flow field can be achieved using observations available only in a subregion of the domain, possibly far from the boundary. We focus on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded physical domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Building on the continuous data assimilation framework of Azouani, Olson, and Titi (2014), we rigorously prove that the assimilated solution converges globally to the true solution under suitable conditions on the nudging parameter, spatial resolution, and the geometry of the observation region, specifically, when the maximum distance from any point in the domain to the observational subregion is bounded by a constant multiple of \\( ν^{1/2} \\) (in terms of scaling). Our computational results, conducted via finite element methods over complex geometries, support the theoretical findings and reveal even greater robustness in practice. Specifically, synchronization with the true solution is achieved even when the observational subregion lies farther from the rest of the domain than the theoretical threshold permits. Across all three tested scenarios, the local nudging algorithm performs comparably to full-domain assimilation, reaching global accuracy up to machine precision. Interestingly, observational data near the boundary are found to be largely uninformative. This demonstrates that full observability is not necessary: carefully chosen interior observations, even far from the boundary, can suffice."}

Leveraging this topological equivalence, a collision-free sectorial partition mechanism is designed in the multi-hole disk, which rigorously induces strictly connected subregions and workload balance on the poriferous surfaces. This mechanism utilizes a buffer-based sequence mechanism to ensure strict topological safety when bypassing obstacles. Furthermore, a pull-back Riemannian metric is constructed to define the length metric that encodes safety constraints. Based on this metric, a distributed gradient-based control law is synthesized to drive agents toward optimal configurations, ensuring simultaneous obstacle avoidance and coverage optimization. Theoretical analyses guarantee the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the partition dynamics and the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations confirm the reachability and robustness of the proposed coverage algorithm, offering a scalable solution for distributed coverage in poriferous surfaces."}

The length of their final submissions increased. Between consecutive submissions, average edit distances increased while average score improvement decreased, suggesting that both student productivity and learning have decreased after ChatGPT's release. Additionally, there are statistically significant correlations between these behavioral changes and their overall performance.

These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing.

As an open ISA, RISC-V lowers the barriers to processor design and encourages widespread adoption, but also exposes processors to security risks such as functional bugs. Processor fuzzing is a powerful technique for automatically detecting these bugs. However, existing fuzzing methods suffer from two main limitations. First, their emphasis on redundant test case generation causes them to overlook cross-processor corner cases. Second, they rely too heavily on coverage guidance. Current coverage metrics are biased and inefficient, and become ineffective once coverage growth plateaus. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimFuzz, a fuzzing framework that constructs a high-quality seed corpus from historical bug-triggering inputs and employs similarity-guided, block-level mutation to efficiently explore the processor input space. By introducing instruction similarity, SimFuzz expands the input space around seeds while preserving control-flow structure, enabling deeper exploration without relying on coverage feedback. We evaluate SimFuzz on three widely used open-source RISC-V processors: Rocket, BOOM, and XiangShan, and discover 17 bugs in total, including 14 previously unknown issues, 7 of which have been assigned CVE identifiers. These bugs affect the decode and memory units, cause instruction and data errors, and can lead to kernel instability or system crashes. Experimental results show that SimFuzz achieves up to 73.22% multiplexer coverage on the high-quality seed corpus. Our findings highlight critical security bugs in mainstream RISC-V processors and offer actionable insights for improving functional verification."}

For this, a strong theoretical foundation has to be established. We contribute to this by rigorously analyzing a Random Local Search (RLS) algorithm that aims to find a minimum dominating set on a graph. We consider its performance on cycle graphs with $n$ vertices. We prove an upper bound for the expected runtime until an optimum is found of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^4\\log^2(n)\\right)$. In doing so, we introduce several models to represent dominating sets on cycles that help us understand how RLS explores the search space to find an optimum.

While interactive prompting has been extensively studied, comparatively less is known about how people communicate specifications for these types of long-horizon tasks. In a qualitative study in which 16 professionals drafted specifications for both a human colleague and an AI, we found a core divergence in how people specified problems to people versus AI: people approached communication with humans as providing a \"compass\", offering high-level intent to encourage flexible exploration. In contrast, communication with AI resembled painstakingly laying down \"railway tracks\": rigid, exhaustive instructions to minimize ambiguity and deviation. This strategy was driven by a perception that current AI has limited ability to infer intent, prioritize, and make judgments on its own. When envisioning an idealAI collaborator, users expressed a desire for a hybrid between current AI and human colleagues: a collaborator that blends AI's efficiency and large context window with the critical thinking and agency of a human colleague. We discuss design implications for future AI systems, proposing that they align on outcomes through generated rough drafts, verify feasibility via end-to-end \"test runs,\" and monitor execution through intelligent check-ins, ultimately transforming AI from a passive instruction-follower into a reliable collaborator for ambiguous, long-horizon problems."}

Current ID methods typically rely on carefully crafted priors or extensive haze-free ground truth, both of which are expensive or impractical to acquire, particularly in the context of scientific imaging. We propose a new unsupervised learning framework called Equivariant Image Dehazing (EID) that exploits the symmetry of image signals to restore clarity to hazy observations. By enforcing haze consistency and systematic equivariance, EID can recover clear patterns directly from raw, hazy images. Additionally, we propose an adversarial learning strategy to model unknown haze physics and facilitate EID learning. Experiments on two scientific image dehazing benchmarks (including cell microscopy and medical endoscopy) and on natural image dehazing have demonstrated that EID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. By unifying equivariant learning with modelling haze physics, we hope that EID will enable more versatile and effective haze removal in scientific imaging. Code and datasets will be published."}

This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%).

To address this gap, we introduce ATOD, a benchmark and synthetic dialogue generation pipeline that produces richly annotated conversations requiring long-term reasoning. ATOD captures key characteristics of advanced TOD, including multi-goal coordination, dependency management, memory, adaptability, and proactivity. Building on ATOD, we propose ATOD-Eval, a holistic evaluation framework that translates these dimensions into fine-grained metrics and supports reproducible offline and online evaluation. We further present a strong agentic memory-based evaluator for benchmarking on ATOD.

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

In the case of $N=4$ servers and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers with $K=2$ messages, we characterize the achievable region and show that the three main inequalities compared to the no-security case collapse to two inequalities in the asymmetric security case. In the general case, we derive bounds that need to be satisfied for the general achievable region for an arbitrary number of servers and messages. In addition, we provide the storage and retrieval scheme for the case of $N=4$ servers with $K=2$ messages and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers, such that the messages are not replicated (in the sense of a coded version of each symbol) and at the same time achieve the optimal achievable rate for the case of replication.

We present a systematic study of metadata-aware retrieval strategies, comparing plain-text baselines with approaches that embed metadata directly. Our evaluation spans metadata-as-text (prefix and suffix), a dual-encoder unified embedding that fuses metadata and content in a single index, dual-encoder late-fusion retrieval, and metadata-aware query reformulation. Across multiple retrieval metrics and question types, we find that prefixing and unified embeddings consistently outperform plain-text baselines, with the unified at times exceeding prefixing while being easier to maintain. Beyond empirical comparisons, we analyze embedding space, showing that metadata integration improves effectiveness by increasing intra-document cohesion, reducing inter-document confusion, and widening the separation between relevant and irrelevant chunks. Field-level ablations show that structural cues provide strong disambiguating signals. Our code, evaluation framework, and the RAGMATE-10K dataset are publicly hosted."}

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

The incompatibility of tokenization schemes between teacher and student models has largely prevented fine-grained, white-box distillation of preference information. To address this gap, we propose Cross-Tokenizer Preference Distillation (CTPD), the first unified framework for transferring human-aligned behavior between models with heterogeneous tokenizers. CTPD introduces three key innovations: (1) Aligned Span Projection, which maps teacher and student tokens to shared character-level spans for precise supervision transfer; (2) a cross-tokenizer adaptation of Token-level Importance Sampling (TIS-DPO) for improved credit assignment; and (3) a Teacher-Anchored Reference, allowing the student to directly leverage the teacher's preferences in a DPO-style objective. Our theoretical analysis grounds CTPD in importance sampling, and experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm its effectiveness, with significant performance gains over existing methods. These results establish CTPD as a practical and general solution for preference distillation across diverse tokenization schemes, opening the door to more accessible and efficient alignment of language models."}

We found that strong reasoning models avoided Einstellung-based traps more often than weaker reasoning models, achieving human-level performance on mARC. On questions most commonly missed by physicians, the top 5 performing models answered 55% to 70% correctly with high confidence, indicating that these models may be less susceptible than humans to Einstellung effects.

Yet most existing models learn topics in disjoint, language-specific spaces and rely on alignment mechanisms (e.g., bilingual dictionaries) that often fail to capture deep cross-lingual semantics, resulting in loosely connected topic spaces. Moreover, these approaches often overlook the rich semantic signals embedded in multilingual pretrained representations, further limiting their ability to capture fine-grained alignment. We introduce GloCTM (Global Context Space for Cross-Lingual Topic Model), a novel framework that enforces cross-lingual topic alignment through a unified semantic space spanning the entire model pipeline. GloCTM constructs enriched input representations by expanding bag-of-words with cross-lingual lexical neighborhoods, and infers topic proportions using both local and global encoders, with their latent representations aligned through internal regularization. At the output level, the global topic-word distribution, defined over the combined vocabulary, structurally synchronizes topic meanings across languages. To further ground topics in deep semantic space, GloCTM incorporates a Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) loss that aligns the latent topic space with multilingual contextual embeddings. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GloCTM significantly improves topic coherence and cross-lingual alignment, outperforming strong baselines."}

This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations.

We lack understanding of BLV job seekers' experiences in today's AI-driven hiring ecosystem. Without such understanding, we risk designing technologies that create new systemic barriers for BLV job seekers rather than providing support. To this end, we conducted interviews with 17 BLV job seekers and analyzed their experiences with AI-powered hiring systems. We found that AI hiring systems misrepresented their professional identities and created dehumanizing interactions. To level the playing field, BLV job seekers used strategic counter-navigation: they deployed their own tools to bypass algorithmic screening and built peer networks to share AI literacy. They also practiced 'strategic refusal', choosing to avoid certain AI systems to regain their agency.

To address these challenges, we propose MyGram, a modality-aware graph transformer with global distribution for multi-modal entity alignment. Specifically, we develop a modality diffusion learning module to capture deep structural contextual information within modalities and enable fine-grained multi-modal fusion. In addition, we introduce a Gram Loss that acts as a regularization constraint by minimizing the volume of a 4-dimensional parallelotope formed by multi-modal features, thereby achieving global distribution consistency across modalities. We conduct experiments on five public datasets.

But what happens if the context does not align with model priors or safety protocols? In this paper, we investigate how LLMs behave and reason when presented with counterfactual or even adversarial medical evidence. We first construct MedCounterFact, a counterfactual medical QA dataset that requires the models to answer clinical comparison questions (i.e., judge the efficacy of certain treatments, with evidence consisting of randomized controlled trials provided as context). In MedCounterFact, real-world medical interventions within the questions and evidence are systematically replaced with four types of counterfactual stimuli, ranging from unknown words to toxic substances. Our evaluation across multiple frontier LLMs on MedCounterFact reveals that in the presence of counterfactual evidence, existing models overwhelmingly accept such \"evidence\" at face value even when it is dangerous or implausible, and provide confident and uncaveated answers. While it may be prudent to draw a boundary between faithfulness and safety, our findings reveal that there exists no such boundary yet."}

Despite its success, how to design a retriever for agentic search remains largely underexplored. Existing search agents typically rely on similarity-based retrievers, while similar passages are not always useful for final answer generation. In this paper, we propose a novel retriever training framework tailored for agentic search. Unlike retrievers designed for single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that only rely on local passage utility, we propose to use both local query-passage relevance and global answer correctness to measure passage utility in a multi-turn agentic search. We further introduce an iterative training strategy, where the search agent and the retriever are optimized bidirectionally and iteratively. Different from RAG retrievers that are only trained once with fixed questions, our retriever is continuously improved using evolving and higher-quality queries from the agent. Extensive experiments on seven single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that our retriever, termed \\ours{}, consistently outperforms strong baselines across different search agents.

More precisely, different state-action pairs exhibit different degree of importance or difficulty which must be actively and explicitly built into a controlled exploration strategy. To this end, we propose a weighted and parameterized family of concave coverage objectives, denoted by $U_ρ$, defined directly over state--action occupancy measures. This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_ρ$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_ρ$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern. Moreover, we show that as $ρ$ increases, the resulting exploration strategy increasingly emphasizes the least-explored state--action pairs, recovering worst-case coverage behavior in the limit."}

To address this limitation, we propose PPA-Plan, a proactive planning strategy for long-context reasoning that focuses on preventing such failures before plan generation. PPA-Plan identifies potential logical pitfalls and false assumptions, formulates them as negative constraints, and conditions plan generation on explicitly avoiding these constraints.

Although myriads of large-scale pre-training efforts have built versatile foundation models that exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities to facilitate OVOD, the necessity of creating a universal understanding for any object cognition according to already pretrained foundation models is usually overlooked. Therefore, in this paper, a training-free Guess What Vision Language Model, called GW-VLM, is proposed to form a universal understanding paradigm based on our carefully designed Multi-Scale Visual Language Searching (MS-VLS) coupled with Contextual Concept Prompt (CCP) for OVOD. This approach can engage a pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in the game of \"guess what\".

Finally, the extensive experiments are carried out on natural and remote sensing datasets, including COCO val, Pascal VOC, DIOR, and NWPU-10, and the results indicate that our proposed GW-VLM can achieve superior OVOD performance compared to the-state-of-the-art methods without any training step."}

Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate.

Some researches have discovered that ``a backdoor path\" in the representations from forgery-irrelevant information to labels induces biased learning, thereby hindering the generalization. In this paper, these forgery-irrelevant information are collectively termed spurious correlations factors. Previous methods predominantly focused on identifying concrete, specific spurious correlation and designing corresponding solutions to address them. However, spurious correlations arise from unobservable confounding factors, making it impractical to identify and address each one individually. To address this, we propose an intervention paradigm for representation space. Instead of tracking and blocking various instance-level spurious correlation one by one, we uniformly model them as a low-rank subspace and intervene in them. Specifically, we decompose spurious correlation features into a low-rank subspace via orthogonal low-rank projection, subsequently removing this subspace from the original representation and training its orthogonal complement to capture forgery-related features. This low-rank projection removal effectively eliminates spurious correlation factors, ensuring that classification decision is based on authentic forgery cues. With only 0.43M trainable parameters, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks, demonstrating excellent robustness and generalization."}

Furthermore, there is no common framework for describing different types and levels of evaluator access. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of access methods for dangerous capability evaluations. We disentangle three aspects of access: model access, model information, and evaluation timeframe. For each aspect, we review benefits and risks, including how expanding access can reduce false negatives and improve stakeholder trust, but can also increase security and capacity challenges. We argue that these limitations can likely be mitigated through technical means and safeguards used in other industries. Based on the taxonomy, we propose three descriptive access levels: AL1 (black-box model access and minimal information), AL2 (grey-box model access and substantial information), and AL3 (white-box model access and comprehensive information), to support clearer communication between evaluators, frontier AI companies, and policymakers. We believe these levels correspond to the different standards for appropriate access defined in the EU Code of Practice, though these standards may change over time."}

The visual nervous system (VNS) is a good example that meets the above requirements because it learns from few visual experiences. Therefore, we used a Gabor filter, a model of the feature extractor of the VNS, as a preprocessor for CNNs to investigate the accuracy of the CNNs trained with small amounts of data. To evaluate how well CNNs trained on image data acquired under a limited variation of conditions generalize to data acquired under other conditions, we created an image dataset consisting of images acquired from different camera positions, and investigated the accuracy of the CNNs that trained using images acquired at a certain distance. The results were compared after training on multiple CNN architectures with and without Gabor filters as preprocessing.

While LLMs are already achieving near-human accuracy on objective annotation tasks, their performance on subjective annotation tasks, such as those involving psychological constructs, is less consistent and more prone to errors. Standard evaluation practices typically collapse all annotation errors into a single alignment metric, but this simplified approach may obscure different kinds of errors that affect final analytical conclusions in different ways. Here, we propose a diagnostic evaluation paradigm that incorporates a human-in-the-loop step to separate task-inherent ambiguity from model-driven inaccuracies and assess annotation quality in terms of their potential downstream impacts. We refine this paradigm on ordinal annotation tasks, which are common in subjective annotation. The refined paradigm includes: (1) a diagnostic taxonomy that categorizes LLM annotation errors along two dimensions: source (model-specific vs. task-inherent) and type (boundary ambiguity vs. conceptual misidentification); (2) a lightweight human annotation test to estimate task-inherent ambiguity from LLM annotations; and (3) a computational method to decompose observed LLM annotation errors following our taxonomy. We validate this paradigm on four educational annotation tasks, demonstrating both its conceptual validity and practical utility. Theoretically, our work provides empirical evidence for why excessively high alignment is unrealistic in specific annotation tasks and why single alignment metrics inadequately reflect the quality of LLM annotations. In practice, our paradigm can be a low-cost diagnostic tool that assesses the suitability of a given task for LLM annotation and provides actionable insights for further technical optimization."}

About twenty-five years since the formal institutionalization of integrated oncology, it is opportune to synthesize the trajectory of evidence for TCM as an adjuvant to radiotherapy. Here we conduct a large-scale analysis of 69,745 publications (2000 - 2025), emerging a cyclical evolution defined by coordinated expansion and contraction in publication output, international collaboration, and funding commitments that mirrors a define-ideate-test pattern. Using a theme modeling workflow designed to determine a stable thematic structure of the field, we identify five dominant thematic axes - cancer types, supportive care, clinical endpoints, mechanisms, and methodology - that signal a focus on patient well-being, scientific rigor and mechanistic exploration. Cross-theme integration of TCM is patient-centered and systems-oriented. Together with the emergent cycles of evolution, the thematic structure demonstrates progressive specialization and potential defragmentation of the field or saturation of existing research agenda. The analysis points to a field that has matured its current research agenda and is likely at the cusp of something new. Additionally, the field exhibits positive reporting of findings that is homogeneous across publication types, thematic areas, and the cycles of evolution suggesting a system-wide positive reporting bias agnostic to structural drivers."}

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $Γ$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $φ$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $Γ$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $Γ$ to $NΓ$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(Γ)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $Ω(Γ)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $Γ=Θ(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $ν$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $Γ$."}

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation."}

However, in this context, image retrieval typically focuses more on the image pairs of geometric matchability than on those of semantic similarity, a nuance that most existing deep learning-based methods guided by batched binaries (overlapping vs. non-overlapping pairs) fail to capture. In this paper, we introduce SupScene, a novel solution that learns global descriptors tailored for finding overlapping image pairs of similar geometric nature for SfM. First, to better underline co-visible regions, we employ a subgraph-based training strategy that moves beyond equally important isolated pairs, leveraging ground-truth geometric overlapping relationships with various weights to provide fine-grained supervision via a soft supervised contrastive loss. Second, we introduce DiVLAD, a DINO-inspired VLAD aggregator that leverages the inherent multi-head attention maps from the last block of ViT. And then, a learnable gating mechanism is designed to adaptively utilize these semantically salient cues with visual features, enabling a more discriminative global descriptor. Extensive experiments on the GL3D dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming NetVLAD while introducing a negligible number of additional trainable parameters. Furthermore, we show that the proposed training strategy brings consistent gains across different aggregation techniques.

Instead, we focus on Macro-F1 as a more representative measure of a model's ability across the long-tail of event types.

However, supply chain entities involved in the design and fabrication of COTS components are considered untrusted from the consumer's standpoint due to the potential insertion of hidden malicious logic or hardware Trojans (HTs). Existing solutions to detect Trojans are largely inapplicable for COTS components due to their black-box nature and lack of access to a golden model. A few studies that apply require expensive equipment, lack scalability, and apply to a limited class of Trojans. In this work, we present a novel golden-free trust verification framework, COVERT for COTS microprocessors, which can efficiently test the presence of hardware Trojan implants by identifying microarchitectural rare events and transferring activation knowledge from existing processor designs to trigger highly susceptible internal nodes. COVERT leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate test programs that trigger rare microarchitectural events, which may be exploited to develop Trojan trigger conditions. By deriving these events from publicly available Register Transfer Level implementations, COVERT can verify a wide variety of COTS microprocessors that inherit the same Instruction Set Architecture. We have evaluated the proposed framework on open-source RISC-V COTS microprocessors and demonstrated its effectiveness in activating combinational and sequential Trojan triggers with high coverage, highlighting the efficiency of the trust verification. By pruning rare microarchitectural events from mor1kx Cappuccino OpenRISC processor design, COVERT has been able to achieve more than 80% trigger coverage for the rarest 5% of events in or1k Marocchino and PicoRV32 as COTS processors."}

On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters."}

Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes. We further observe reduced structured errors that are visually correlated with oscillatory components on several scientific benchmarks, suggesting that geometric preconditioning combined with curriculum training is a practical approach for stabilizing quantum regression."}

First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features.

Typically operating in a black-box manner, it employs an encoder-decoder framework for watermark embedding and extraction. While existing research has focused primarily on the encoders for the robustness to resist various attacks, the decoders have been largely overlooked, leading to attacks against the watermark. In this paper, we identify one such attack against the decoder, where query responses are utilized to obtain backpropagated gradients to train a watermark remover. To address this issue, we propose Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs), a family of defense mechanisms, including DGS at the output (DGS-O), at the input (DGS-I), and in the layers (DGS-L) of the decoder, with a closed-form solution for DGS-O and provable performance for all DGS. Leveraging the joint design of reorienting and rescaling of the gradients from watermark channel gradient leaking queries, the proposed DGSs effectively prevent the watermark remover from achieving training convergence to the desired low-loss value, while preserving image quality of the decoder output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DGSs in diverse application scenarios. Our experimental results on deraining and image generation tasks with the state-of-the-art box-free watermarking show that our DGSs achieve a defense success rate of 100% under all settings."}

To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines."}

Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets.

DoublyCal employs a lightweight proxy model to first generate KG evidence alongside a calibrated evidence confidence. This calibrated supporting evidence then guides a black-box LLM, yielding final predictions that are not only more accurate but also well-calibrated, with confidence scores traceable to the uncertainty of the supporting evidence.

A set \\(X_N\\) of \\(N\\) points on the unit sphere \\(\\mathbb{S}^d\\) is called a \\textit{spherical \\(t\\)-design} if the average value of any polynomial of degree at most \\(t\\) over \\(X_N\\) equals its average over the entire sphere. Spherical designs represent one of the most significant topics in the study of point distributions on spheres. They are deeply connected to algebraic combinatorics, discrete geometry, differential geometry, approximation theory, optimization, coding theory, quantum physics, and other fields, which have led to the development of profound and elegant mathematical theories. This article reviews fundamental theoretical results, numerical construction methods, and applied outcomes related to spherical designs. Key topics covered include existence proofs, optimization-based construction techniques, fast computational algorithms, and applications in interpolation, numerical integration, hyperinterpolation, signal and image processing, as well as numerical solutions to partial differential and integral equations."}

In the context of fuzz testing, the fuzzer supplies varied inputs to fuzz targets, which are designed to comprehensively exercise critical sections of the client code. Various studies have focused on optimizing and developing advanced fuzzers, such as AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, syzkaller, ISP-Fuzzer, which have substantially enhanced vulnerability detection in widely used software and libraries. Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets. In large-scale software projects and libraries -- characterized by numerous user defined functions and data types -- manual creation of fuzz targets is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This challenge underscores the need for automated techniques not only to generate fuzz targets but also to streamline the execution and analysis of their results. In this paper, we introduce an approach to improving fuzz target generation through static analysis of library source code. The proposed method encompasses several key aspects: it analyzes source code structures to accurately construct function calls and generate fuzz targets; it maps fuzzer input data to the corresponding function parameters; it synthesizes compilation information for the fuzz targets; and it automatically collects and analyzes execution results. Our findings are demonstrated through the application of this approach to the generation of fuzz targets for C/C++ libraries."}

To address this, we propose Metacognitive Agent Reflective Self-improvement (MARS), a framework that achieves efficient self-evolution within a single recurrence cycle. Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MARS outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving systems while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

In this article, we study the effectiveness of linearization for reconstructing a conductivity from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, combining rigorous analysis with numerical experiments. In particular, we prove that any DtN map arising from a radial conductivity in the unit ball of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ admits an exact representation as a linearized DtN map for a uniquely determined integrable function, the Born approximation. We linearize on a family of background conductivities that includes the constant case, giving a rigorous foundation for linearization-based methods in this framework. We also characterize the Born approximation as a solution of a generalized moment problem. Since this moment problem is formally well-defined even for non-radial conductivities, we use it to develop a numerical algorithm to reconstruct the Born approximation of a general conductivity on the unit disk. We provide numerical experiments to test the resolution and robustness of the Born approximation in different situations. Finally, we show how it can be used as the starting point of an algorithm for reconstructing a conductivity from its DtN map."}

Pages are then clustered according to the score distribution to adaptively select relevant content. The clustered pages are screened again by Top-K to keep the context compact. However, for short documents, clustering reliability decreases, so we use a relevance probability threshold to select pages. The selected pages alone are fed to a frozen LVLM for answer generation, eliminating the need for model fine-tuning. The proposed AVIR framework reduces the average page count required for question answering by 70%, while achieving an ANLS of 84.58% on the MP-DocVQA dataset-surpassing previous methods with significantly lower computational cost.

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

Existing methods typically assume consistent news topic distribution between training and test phases, failing to detect fake news videos tied to emerging events and unseen topics. To bridge this gap, we introduce RADAR, the first framework that enables test-time adaptation to unseen news videos. RADAR pioneers a new retrieval-guided adaptation paradigm that leverages stable (source-close) videos from the target domain to guide robust adaptation of semantically related but unstable instances. Specifically, we propose an Entropy Selection-Based Retrieval mechanism that provides videos with stable (low-entropy), relevant references for adaptation. We also introduce a Stable Anchor-Guided Alignment module that explicitly aligns unstable instances' representations to the source domain via distribution-level matching with their stable references, mitigating severe domain discrepancies. Finally, our novel Target-Domain Aware Self-Training paradigm can generate informative pseudo-labels augmented by stable references, capturing varying and imbalanced category distributions in the target domain and enabling RADAR to adapt to the fast-changing label distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RADAR achieves superior performance for test-time FNVD, enabling strong on-the-fly adaptation to unseen fake news video topics."}

We show that the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by the number of chains, even with only two prescribed processing times and two distinct time-window lengths. This hardness remains even for distinct processing times and time windows under prec-consistent time windows. On the positive side, we obtain polynomial-time algorithm when all jobs share a single time-window length and FPT when the processing times, release times and deadlines are chain-uniform. We also show that the problem lies in XP when parameterized by the width of the precedence relation."}

Convolutional feature maps are reinterpreted as patch-level graphs, where nodes encode both appearance and spatial coordinates, and edges reflect local structural adjacency. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on generic message passing, we introduce a custom structural propagation mechanism that explicitly models relative spatial relations as part of the reasoning process. This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability. While evaluated in a medical imaging context, the framework is domain-agnostic and aligns with the broader vision of graph-based reasoning across artificial intelligence systems. This work contributes to the growing body of research exploring graphs as computational substrates for structure-aware and explainable learning."}

To tell these actions apart, human often rely on the objects the driver is using, such as holding a phone compared with gripping the steering wheel. However, most existing driver-monitoring datasets lack accurate object-location annotations or do not link objects to their associated actions, leaving a critical gap for reliable action recognition. To address this, we introduce the Driver Action with Object Synergy (DAOS) dataset, comprising 9,787 video clips annotated with 36 fine-grained driver actions and 15 object classes, totaling more than 2.5 million corresponding object instances. DAOS offers multi-modal, multi-view data (RGB, IR, and depth) from front, face, left, and right perspectives. Although DAOS captures a wide range of cabin objects, only a few are directly relevant to each action for prediction, so focusing on task-specific human-object relations is essential. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Action-Object-Relation Network (AOR-Net). AOR-Net comprehends complex driver actions through multi-level reasoning and a chain-of-action prompting mechanism that models the logical relationships among actions, objects, and their relations. Additionally, the Mixture of Thoughts module is introduced to dynamically select essential knowledge at each stage, enhancing robustness in object-rich and object-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various datasets."}

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines."}

Mining these long-tail events from massive real-world driving logs is therefore a critical step in the robotic development lifecycle. The goal of the Scenario Mining task is to retrieve useful information to enable targeted re-simulation, regression testing, and failure analysis of the robot's decision-making algorithms. RefAV, introduced by the Argoverse team, is an end-to-end framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to spatially and temporally localize scenarios described in natural language. However, this process performs retrieval on trajectory labels, ignoring the direct connection between natural language and raw RGB images, which runs counter to the intuition of video retrieval; it also depends on the quality of upstream 3D object detection and tracking. Further, inaccuracies in trajectory data lead to inaccuracies in downstream spatial and temporal localization. To address these issues, we propose Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine (SMc2f), a coarse-to-fine pipeline that employs vision-language models (VLMs) for coarse image-text filtering, builds a database of successful mining cases on top of RefAV and automatically retrieves exemplars to few-shot condition the LLM for more robust retrieval, and introduces text-trajectory contrastive learning to pull matched pairs together and push mismatched pairs apart in a shared embedding space, yielding a fine-grained matcher that refines the LLM's candidate trajectories.

On the one hand, the SSM reveals how vanilla empirical risk minimization preferentially learns to distinguish majority classes over minorities early in training, consequently delaying minority learning. In stark contrast, reweighting restores balanced learning dynamics, enabling the simultaneous learning of features associated with both majorities and minorities."}

In this study, we examine methods to achieve real-time prediction of surgical skill level in real-time based on Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores. Using data acquired from the da Vinci Surgical System, we carry out three main analyses, focusing on model design, their real-time performance, and their skill-level-based cross-validation training. For the model design, we evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal deep learning models for predicting surgical skill levels using synchronized kinematic and vision data. Our models include separate unimodal baselines and fusion architectures that integrate features from both modalities and are evaluated using mean Spearman's correlation coefficients, demonstrating that the fusion model consistently outperforms unimodal models for real-time predictions. For the real-time performance, we observe the prediction's trend over time and highlight correlation with the surgeon's gestures. For the skill-level-based cross-validation, we separately trained models on surgeons with different skill levels, which showed that high-skill demonstrations allow for better performance than those trained on low-skilled ones and generalize well to similarly skilled participants. Our findings show that multimodal learning allows more stable fine-grained evaluation of surgical performance and highlights the value of expert-level training data for model generalization."}

Benchmarking Structural Correctness-Sustainability Trade-offs in Novel Structured Output Formats", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly required to generate structured, machine-readable outputs for downstream systems. While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments."}

Traditional threshold-based methods frequently encounter performance degradation due to very high false alarm rates caused by look-alike phenomena such as wind slicks and ship wakes. Here, a hybrid deep learning model, DeepSegFusion, is presented for oil spill segmentation in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The model uses SegNet and DeepLabV3+ integrated with an attention-based feature fusion mechanism to achieve better boundary precision as well as improved contextual understanding. Results obtained on SAR oil spill datasets, including ALOS PALSAR imagery, confirm that the proposed DeepSegFusion model achieves an accuracy of 94.85%, an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.5685, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.9330. The proposed method delivers more than three times fewer false detections compared to individual baseline models and traditional non-segmentation methods, achieving a reduction of 64.4%. These results indicate that DeepSegFusion is a stable model under various marine conditions and can therefore be used in near real-time oil spill monitoring scenarios."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing this issue, their effectiveness is often hindered by Sycophancy, a tendency to produce reasoning that matches users' beliefs over truthful ones, which deviates from instruction-following principles. Rather than treating sycophancy as a flaw to be eliminated, this work proposes a novel approach that initially harnesses this behavior to generate contrastive reasoning from opposing perspectives. Specifically, we design a Self-renewal Opposing-stance Reasoning Generation (SORG) framework that prompts LLMs to produce high-quality agree and disagree reasoning pairs for a given news title without requiring ground-truth labels. To utilize the generated reasoning, we develop a local Opposing Reasoning-based Clickbait Detection (ORCD) model that integrates three BERT encoders to represent the title and its associated reasoning. The model leverages contrastive learning, guided by soft labels derived from LLM-generated credibility scores, to enhance detection robustness. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms LLM prompting, fine-tuned smaller language models, and state-of-the-art clickbait detection baselines."}

Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected.

For fairness, we evaluate English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish; for safety, we focus on English, Korean, and Arabic. Our findings reveal that quantization consistently degrades fairness and safety, with dynamic methods demonstrating greater stability than static ones. Moreover, fairness degradation varies across languages, while safety deterioration is especially pronounced in non-English settings. To address these risks, we introduce Critical Weight Protection, a novel technique that identifies and preserves fairness- and safety-critical weights during quantization. This approach effectively mitigates bias and safety deterioration without costly retraining or alignment, maintaining trustworthiness while retaining efficiency."}

Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution."}

Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties. This framework provides a principled abstraction of structural information and clarifies the role of subarguments in abstract acceptability reasoning."}

PREGU monitors the entropy of the output distribution during autoregressive generation and halts the process whenever entropy exceeds a defined threshold, signaling uncertainty. From that point, a localized search is performed in the latent space to refine the partial reasoning and select the most coherent answer, using the Soft Reasoning method.

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off."}

Moreover, we characterize the achievable computation rate and show that the proposed hierarchical constellations can compute R output functions with decoding error probability epsilon while the gap to the optimal computation rate scales as O(\\log_2(1/ε)/K) for independent source symbols, where K denotes the number of transmitters. Consequently, this gap vanishes as the network size grows, and the optimal rate is asymptotically attained.\n  Furthermore, we introduce a shielding mechanism based on variable-length block coding that mitigates noise-induced error propagation across constellation levels while preserving the superposition structure of the MAC. We show that the shielding technique improves reliability, yielding a gap that scales optimally as O(\\log_2\\ln{(1/ε)}), regardless of the source distribution.

To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) framework. MJP starts with random token shuffling to break the token order, and then a learnable \\textit{unknown (unk)} position embedding is used to mask out the PEs of the shuffled tokens. In this manner, the local spatial information which is encoded in the position embeddings is disrupted, and the models are forced to learn feature representations that are less reliant on the local spatial information.

To bridge this gap, we propose TDP-CR, a task-driven multimodal framework that jointly performs cloud removal and land-cover segmentation. Central to our approach is a Prompt-Guided Fusion (PGF) mechanism, which utilizes a learnable degradation prompt to encode cloud thickness and spatial uncertainty. By combining global channel context with local prompt-conditioned spatial bias, PGF adaptively integrates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) information only where optical data is corrupted.

Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs.

Under this setting, the problem of finding the minimum testing strategy such that collected observations will necessarily let us decide whether the IUT is correct or not (i.e., whether it necessarily belongs to the set of possible correct definitions or not) is studied in four possible problem variants: with or without non-determinism; and with or without more than one possible definition in the sets of possible correct and incorrect definitions. The computational complexity of these variants is studied, and properties such as PSPACE-completeness and Log-APX-hardness are identified."}

This leads annotators to agree on the underlying action while disagreeing on segment boundaries, reducing apparent reliability. We propose codebook-injected segmentation, which conditions boundary decisions on downstream annotation criteria, and evaluate LLM-based segmenters against standard and retrieval-augmented baselines. To assess these without gold labels, we introduce evaluation metrics for span consistency, distinctiveness, and human-AI distributional agreement. We found DA-awareness produces segments that are internally more consistent than text-only baselines. While LLMs excel at creating construct-consistent spans, coherence-based baselines remain superior at detecting global shifts in dialogue flow. Across two datasets, no single segmenter dominates. Improvements in within-segment coherence frequently trade off against boundary distinctiveness and human-AI distributional agreement. These results highlight segmentation as a consequential design choice that should be optimized for downstream objectives rather than a single performance score."}

Recent research tends to use modality-shared language prompts generated by CLIP to guide the learning of modal-invariant representations. Despite achieving optimal performance, such methods still face limitations in efficient spatial-temporal modeling, sufficient cross-modal interaction, and explicit modality-level loss guidance. To address these issues, we propose the language-driven sequence-level modal-invariant representation learning (LSMRL) method, which includes spatial-temporal feature learning (STFL) module, semantic diffusion (SD) module and cross-modal interaction (CMI) module. To enable parameter- and computation-efficient spatial-temporal modeling, the STFL module is built upon CLIP with minimal modifications. To achieve sufficient cross-modal interaction and enhance the learning of modal-invariant features, the SD module is proposed to diffuse modality-shared language prompts into visible and infrared features to establish preliminary modal consistency. The CMI module is further developed to leverage bidirectional cross-modal self-attention to eliminate residual modality gaps and refine modal-invariant representations. To explicitly enhance the learning of modal-invariant representations, two modality-level losses are introduced to improve the features' discriminative ability and their generalization to unseen categories. Extensive experiments on large-scale VVI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of LSMRL over AOTA methods."}

This approach discards the rich structural and contextual priors present in the original input video. Consequently, such methods often lack sufficient guidance, leading to incomplete object erasure or the synthesis of implausible content that conflicts with the scene's physical logic. In this paper, we reformulate video object removal as a video-to-video translation task via a stochastic bridge model. Unlike noise-initialized methods, our framework establishes a direct stochastic path from the source video (with objects) to the target video (objects removed). This bridge formulation effectively leverages the input video as a strong structural prior, guiding the model to perform precise removal while ensuring that the filled regions are logically consistent with the surrounding environment. To address the trade-off where strong bridge priors hinder the removal of large objects, we propose a novel adaptive mask modulation strategy. This mechanism dynamically modulates input embeddings based on mask characteristics, balancing background fidelity with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and temporal consistency."}

This work presents a mechanistic study of that choice by extracting an \\emph{arbitration vector} from model activations on a curated dataset designed to disentangle (i) irrelevant contexts that elicit parametric recall and (ii) relevant but false contexts that elicit copying. The vector is computed as the residual-stream centroid difference between these regimes across 27 relations, and is injected as an additive intervention at selected layers and token spans to steer behavior in two directions: Copy$\\rightarrow$Recall (suppressing context use) and Recall$\\rightarrow$Copy (inducing the model to copy any token from the context). Experiments on two architectures (decoder-only and encoder/decoder) and two open-domain QA benchmarks show consistent behavior shifts under moderate scaling while monitoring accuracy and fluency. Mechanistic analyses of attention routing, MLP contributions, and layer-wise probability trajectories reveal an asymmetry: inducing copying is an easy ``reactivation'' process that can be triggered at different locations in the input, while restoring recall is a ``suppression'' process that is more fragile and strongly tied to object-token interventions."}

Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation. Extensive experiments on RS-RVOS Bench demonstrate that MQC-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Retrieval augmentation provides a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning by conditioning LLMs on user history records, and existing approaches typically select these records based on semantic relevance. We argue that relevance serves as an unreliable proxy for utility: a record may be semantically similar to a query yet fail to improve generation quality or even degrade it due to redundancy or conflicting information. To bridge this gap, we propose PURPLE, a contextual bandit framework that oPtimizes UseR Profiles for Llm pErsonalization. In contrast to a greedy selection of the most relevant records, PURPLE treats profile construction as a set generation process and utilizes a Plackett-Luce ranking model to capture complex inter-record dependencies. By training with dense feedback provided by the likelihood of the reference response, our method aligns retrieval directly with generation quality. Extensive experiments on nine personalization tasks demonstrate that PURPLE consistently outperforms strong heuristic and retrieval-augmented baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, establishing a principled and scalable solution for optimizing user profiles."}

Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality annotation has led to a reliance on inharmonious synthetic data, resulting in poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a Foreground Consistent Learning model, dubbed as FCLM, to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we first introduce a Depth-Aware Distillation strategy where we transfer the depth-related knowledge for better foreground representation. Considering the data dilemma, we term the processing of synthetic data as domain adaptation problem where we propose a domain-invariant learning strategy to focus on foreground learning. To support interactive prediction, we contribute an Object-Oriented Decoder that can receive both visual and language prompts to predict the referring target. Experimental results show that our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms SOTA methods."}

To address this, we present the AI-Aided Conversation Engine (ACE), a system that supports the deliberate design of human-robot conversations. ACE contributes three key innovations: 1) an LLM-powered voice agent that scaffolds initial prompt creation to overcome the \"blank page problem,\" 2) an annotation interface that enables the collection of granular and grounded feedback on conversational transcripts, and 3) using LLMs to translate user feedback into prompt refinements. We evaluated ACE through two user studies, examining both designs' experience and end users' interactions with robots designed using ACE.

We propose a novel method for 6DoF pose estimation focused specifically on bins used in industrial settings. We exploit the cuboid geometry of bins by first detecting intermediate 3D line segments corresponding to their top edges. Our approach extends the 2D line segment detection network LeTR to operate on structured point cloud data.

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness."}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful solution that embeds physical laws in training by enforcing equation residuals.

To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability. This work connects long-standing perturbation methods with PINNs, demonstrating how perturbation theory can guide foundational models to solve nonlinear systems with speeds comparable to those of classical solvers."}

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties.

These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR). These results establish that privacy risks of fine-tuned language models are substantially greater than previously understood, with implications for both privacy auditing and deployment decisions.

Existing detection methods achieve near-perfect performance when training and testing are conducted within the same domain, yet their effectiveness deteriorates substantially in crossdomain scenarios. This limitation is problematic, as new forgery techniques continuously emerge and detectors must remain reliable against unseen manipulations. To address this challenge, we propose the Real-Centered Detection Network (RCDN), a frequency spatial convolutional neural networks(CNN) framework with an Xception backbone that anchors its representation space around authentic facial images. Instead of modeling the diverse and evolving patterns of forgeries, RCDN emphasizes the consistency of real images, leveraging a dual-branch architecture and a real centered loss design to enhance robustness under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the DiFF dataset, focusing on three representative forgery types (FE, I2I, T2I), demonstrate that RCDN achieves both state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy and significantly stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, RCDN reduces the generalization gap compared to leading baselines and achieves the highest cross/in-domain stability ratio, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for defending against evolving and unseen image forgery techniques."}

They excel in performing simple and repetitive unimanual tasks but still face challenges with bimanual manipulation. This difficulty arises from the complexities of coordinating dual arms and handling multi-stage processes. Recent integration of generative models into imitation learning (IL) has made progress in tackling specific challenges. However, few approaches explicitly consider the multi-stage nature of bimanual tasks while also emphasizing the importance of inference speed. In multi-stage tasks, failures or delays at any stage can cascade over time, impacting the success and efficiency of subsequent sub-stages and ultimately hindering overall task performance. In this paper, we propose a novel keypose-conditioned coordination-aware consistency policy tailored for bimanual manipulation. Our framework instantiates hierarchical imitation learning with a high-level keypose predictor and a low-level trajectory generator. The predicted keyposes serve as sub-goals for trajectory generation, indicating targets for individual sub-stages. The trajectory generator is formulated as a consistency model, generating action sequences based on historical observations and predicted keyposes in a single inference step. In particular, we devise an innovative approach for identifying bimanual keyposes, considering both robot-centric action features and task-centric operation styles.

We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts.

The proposed system integrates the classical Octomap representation with 3D Gaussian Splatting to enable accurate and efficient target-aware mapping. While a low-resolution Octomap provides probabilistic occupancy information for informative viewpoint selection and collision-free planning, 3D Gaussian Splatting leverages geometric, photometric, and semantic information to optimize a set of 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. We further introduce simple yet effective strategies to enhance robustness against segmentation noise and reduce memory consumption. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms purely occupancy-based approaches in both runtime efficiency and reconstruction accuracy, enabling precise fruit counting and volume estimation. Compared to a 0.01m-resolution Octomap, our approach achieves an improvement of 6.6% in fruit-level F1 score under noise-free conditions, and up to 28.6% under segmentation noise. Additionally, it achieves a 50% reduction in runtime, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time semantic reconstruction in agricultural robotics."}

It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver). Recently, quantum annealing providers have offered more low-latency solutions, e.g., NL-Solver, which paves the road to actually realizing quantum solutions within DBMSs. However, this raises new systems research challenges in balancing efficiency and solution quality.\n  In this talk, we show that this balance is possible to achieve. As a proof of concept, we present Q2O, the first real Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer. We show the end-to-end workflow: we encode the join order problem as a nonlinear model, a format solvable by the NL-Solver, using actual database statistics; the solution is translated into a plan hint that guides PostgreSQL's optimizer to produce a complete plan.

However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them. These findings demonstrate how triadic settings activate socially shared regulation of learning by making AI use visible and accountable to a human peer, suggesting that AI systems that augment rather than automate peer collaboration can better preserve the learning processes that collaborative programming relies on."}

Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space.

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals."}

We tackle these problems with Threshold Differential Attention (TDA), a sink-free attention mechanism that achieves ultra-sparsity and improved robustness at longer sequence lengths without the computational overhead of projection methods or the performance degradation caused by noise accumulation of standard rectified attention. TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows. Empirically, TDA produces $>99\\%$ exact zeros and eliminates attention sinks while maintaining competitive performance on standard and long-context benchmarks."}

However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a \\texttt{gcc} compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75\\%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87\\% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint."}

Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications.

Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously. Trained on a diverse dataset aggregated from publicly available sources, SAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple segmentation and matting benchmarks, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in a wide range of downstream tasks."}

Traditional rule-based tools often overlook the semantic patterns in source code that are crucial for identifying adversarial components. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for software analysis, yet their use in interpretable and modular security pipelines remains limited. This paper presents LAMPS, a multi-agent system that employs collaborative LLMs to detect malicious PyPI packages. The system consists of four role-specific agents for package retrieval, file extraction, classification, and verdict aggregation, coordinated through the CrewAI framework. A prototype combines a fine-tuned CodeBERT model for classification with LLaMA-3 agents for contextual reasoning. LAMPS has been evaluated on two complementary datasets: D1, a balanced collection of 6,000 setup.py files, and D2, a realistic multi-file dataset with 1,296 files and natural class imbalance. On D1, LAMPS achieves 97.7% accuracy, surpassing MPHunter--one of the state-of-the-art approaches. On D2, it reaches 99.5% accuracy and 99.5% balanced accuracy, outperforming RAG-based approaches and fine-tuned single-agent baselines. McNemar's test confirmed these improvements as highly significant.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based THz self-supervised denoising and deblurring network (THz-SSDD). The network employs a Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted self-supervised learning strategy to capture the intrinsic features of noise by exploiting invariance under repeated corruption. PCA decomposition and reconstruction are then applied to restore images across both low and high frequencies. The performance of the THz-SSDD network was evaluated on four types of samples. Training requires only a small set of unlabeled noisy images, and testing across samples with different material properties and measurement modes demonstrates effective denoising and deblurring. Quantitative analysis further validates the network feasibility, showing improvements in image quality while preserving the physical characteristics of the original signals."}

A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation."}

Our mixed-methods study with 54 researchers suggests three key findings in how LLM-based agents reshape scientific creativity: 1) perceived creativity support does not simply increase linearly with greater control; 2) human effort shifts from ideating to verifying ideas; and 3) ownership becomes a negotiated outcome between human and AI. Our findings suggest that LLM agent design should emphasize researcher empowerment, fostering a sense of ownership over strong ideas rather than reducing researchers to operating an automated AI-driven process."}

We analyze a collection of transcribed interviews with cancer patients (132,722 words in 13 interviews). We first evaluate BERTopic and Top2Vec for individual interview summarization by using similar preprocessing, chunking, and clustering configurations to ensure a fair comparison on Keyword Extraction. LLMs (GPT4) are then used for the next step topic labeling. Their outputs for a single interview (I0) are rated through a small-scale human evaluation, focusing on {coherence}, {clarity}, and {relevance}. Based on the preliminary results and evaluation, BERTopic shows stronger performance and is selected for further experimentation using three {clinically oriented embedding} models. We then analyzed the full interview collection with the best model setting. Results show that domain-specific embeddings improved topic \\textit{precision} and \\textit{interpretability}, with BioClinicalBERT producing the most consistent results across transcripts. The global analysis of the full dataset of 13 interviews, using the BioClinicalBERT embedding model, reveals the most dominant topics throughout all 13 interviews, namely ``Coordination and Communication in Cancer Care Management\" and ``Patient Decision-Making in Cancer Treatment Journey''. Although the interviews are machine translations from Dutch to English, and clinical professionals are not involved in this evaluation, the findings suggest that neural topic modeling, particularly BERTopic, can help provide useful feedback to clinicians from patient interviews. This pipeline could support more efficient document navigation and strengthen the role of patients' voices in healthcare workflows."}

This paper introduces collaborative inverse rendering with persistent homology priors, a novel strategy that leverages topological constraints to resolve these ambiguities. By incorporating priors that capture critical features such as tunnel loops and handle loops, our approach directly addresses the difficulty of reconstructing high-genus surfaces. The collaboration between photometric consistency from multi-view images and homology-based guidance enables recovery of complex high-genus geometry while circumventing catastrophic failures such as collapsing tunnels or losing high-genus structure. Instead of neural networks, our method relies on gradient-based optimization within a mesh-based inverse rendering framework to highlight the role of topological priors. Experimental results show that incorporating persistent homology priors leads to lower Chamfer Distance (CD) and higher Volume IoU compared to state-of-the-art mesh-based methods, demonstrating improved geometric accuracy and robustness against topological failure."}

This paper presents the design and implementation of a cycle-accurate, hardware-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) core implemented in SystemVerilog. Unlike conventional accelerators, this design utilizes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model powered by fixed-point arithmetic and bit-wise primitives (shifts and additions) to eliminate the need for complex floating-point hardware. The architecture features an on-chip Poisson encoder for stochastic spike generation and a novel active pruning mechanism that dynamically disables neurons post-classification to minimize dynamic power consumption. We demonstrate the hardware's efficacy through a fully connected layer implementation targeting digit classification. Simulation results indicate that the design achieves rapid convergence (89% accuracy) within limited timesteps while maintaining a significantly reduced computational footprint compared to traditional dense architectures.

The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions."}

The Russian-language output echoed narratives common in Russian state discourse, characterizing civil society actors as illegitimate elites undermining democratic mandates. The Ukrainian-language output adopted vocabulary characteristic of Western liberal-democratic political science, treating the same actors as legitimate stakeholders within democratic contestation.

However, integrating learned models with online planning remains challenging. When dynamics are learned with neural networks, three key difficulties arise: (1) stiff transitions from contact events may be inherited from the data; (2) additional non-physical local nonsmoothness can occur; and (3) training datasets can induce non-Gaussian model errors due to rapid state changes. We address (1) and (2) by introducing the smooth neural surrogate, a neural network with tunable smoothness designed to provide informative predictions and derivatives for trajectory optimization through contact. To address (3), we train these models using a heavy-tailed likelihood that better matches the empirical error distributions observed in legged-robot dynamics. Together, these design choices substantially improve the reliability, scalability, and generalizability of learned legged MPC. Across zero-shot locomotion tasks of increasing difficulty, smooth neural surrogates with robust learning yield consistent reductions in cumulative cost on simple, well-conditioned behaviors (typically 10-50%), while providing substantially larger gains in regimes where standard neural dynamics often fail outright. In these regimes, smoothing enables reliable execution (from 0/5 to 5/5 success) and produces about 2-50x lower cumulative cost, reflecting orders-of-magnitude absolute improvements in robustness rather than incremental performance gains."}

We trained BabyBERTa (Huebner et al. 2021), a transformer model optimized for small datasets, on artificial grammars. The training sets varied in size, number of unique sentence types, and proportion of rule-following versus exception exemplars.

For training, the repetition of dialect tags in transcriptions is estimated either using a proposed Language-Agnostic Heuristic (LAH) approach or a pre-trained ASR model. The method is evaluated on the low-resource Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) task, with experimental results demonstrating that an SSL-based CTC-DID model, trained on a limited dataset, outperforms both fine-tuned Whisper and ECAPA-TDNN models. Notably, CTC-DID also surpasses these models in zero-shot evaluation on the Casablanca dataset. The proposed approach is found to be more robust to shorter utterances and is shown to be easily adaptable for streaming, real-time applications, with minimal performance degradation."}

Given an input string $S$ of length $n$, we can compute a maximal square subsequence of $S$ in $O(n\\log n)$ time, greatly improving the $O(n^2)$ bound for computing the longest square subsequence of $S$. For a maximal $k$-repeating subsequence, our bound is $O(f(k)n\\log n)$, where \\(f(k)\\) is a computable function such that $f(k) < k\\cdot 4^k$. This greatly improves the $O(n^{2k-1})$ bound for computing a longest $k$-repeating subsequence of $S$, for $k\\geq 3$. Both results hold for the constrained case, i.e., when the solution must contain a subsequence $X$ of $S$, though with higher running times."}

Traditional approaches to vocalisation analysis, relying on manual annotation and predefined categories, introduce biases, limit scalability, and fail to capture the full complexity of vocal repertoires. We introduce a computational framework for the automated detection, acoustic feature extraction, and unsupervised learning of chick vocalisations. Applying this framework to a dataset of newly hatched chicks, we identified two primary vocal clusters. We then tested our computational framework on an independent dataset of chicks exposed during embryonic development to vehicle or Valproic Acid (VPA), a compound that disrupts neural development and is linked to autistic-like symptoms. Clustering analysis on the experimental dataset confirmed two primary vocal clusters and revealed systematic differences between groups. VPA-exposed chicks showed an altered repertoire, with a relative increase in softer calls. VPA differentially affected call clusters, modulating temporal, frequency, and energy domain features. Overall, VPA-exposed chicks produced vocalisations with shorter duration, reduced pitch variability, and modified energy profiles, with the strongest alterations observed in louder calls. This study provides a computational framework for analysing animal vocalisations, advancing knowledge of early-life communication in typical and atypical vocal development."}

Conventional pipelines typically rely on manually defined rubrics and fixed conversational context$-$a static approach that limits coverage and fails to capture the diverse, emergent behaviors of dialogue models. To address this, we introduce CoReflect (Conversational Evaluation via Co-Evolutionary Simulation and Reflective Rubric Refinement), which unifies dialogue simulation and evaluation into an adaptive, iterative process. CoReflect employs a conversation planner that generates structured templates to guide a user simulator through diverse, goal-directed dialogues. Subsequently, a reflective analyzer processes these dialogues to identify systematic behavioral patterns and automatically refine the evaluation rubrics. Crucially, the insights from the conversation analysis are fed back into the planner to update conversation templates for subsequent iterations. This co-evolution loop ensures that the complexity of test cases and the diagnostic precision of rubrics improve in tandem. By minimizing human intervention, CoReflect provides a scalable and self-refining methodology that allows evaluation protocols to adapt alongside the rapidly advancing capabilities of dialogue models."}

As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters. We have integrated DaggerFFT into Oceananigans.jl, a geophysical fluid dynamics framework, demonstrating that high-level, task-based runtimes can deliver both superior performance and modularity in large-scale, real-world simulations."}

However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead.

While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models."}

In this work, we introduce SurgRef, a novel motion-guided framework that grounds free-form language expressions in instrument motion, capturing how tools move and interact across time, rather than what they look like. This allows models to understand and segment instruments even under occlusion, ambiguity, or unfamiliar terminology. To train and evaluate SurgRef, we present Ref-IMotion, a diverse, multi-institutional video dataset with dense spatiotemporal masks and rich motion-centric expressions.

Across forecasting physiological and risk modeling tasks the model outperforms strong electronic health record only and wearable only baselines especially at long horizons and under missing data.

To address this, we propose DiffusionQC, which detects artifacts as outliers among clean images using a diffusion model. It requires only a set of clean images for training rather than pixel-level artifact annotations and predefined artifact types. Furthermore, we introduce a contrastive learning module to explicitly enlarge the distribution separation between artifact and clean images, yielding an enhanced version of our method. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance to state-of-the-art and offer cross-stain generalization capacity, with significantly less data and annotations."}

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations.

However, existing approaches rely on visual 3D poses as supervision and directly regress CSI to a camera-based coordinate system. We find that this practice leads to coordinate overfitting: models memorize deployment-specific WiFi transceiver layouts rather than only learning activity-relevant representations, resulting in severe generalization failures. To address this challenge, we present PerceptAlign, the first geometry-conditioned framework for WiFi-based cross-layout pose estimation. PerceptAlign introduces a lightweight coordinate unification procedure that aligns WiFi and vision measurements in a shared 3D space using only two checkerboards and a few photos. Within this unified space, it encodes calibrated transceiver positions into high-dimensional embeddings and fuses them with CSI features, making the model explicitly aware of device geometry as a conditional variable. This design forces the network to disentangle human motion from deployment layouts, enabling robust and, for the first time, layout-invariant WiFi pose estimation. To support systematic evaluation, we construct the largest cross-domain 3D WiFi pose estimation dataset to date, comprising 21 subjects, 5 scenes, 18 actions, and 7 device layouts.

Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction."}

In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \\textit{light-occluding} and \\textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination."}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains.

We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes.

Hypothesis testing is applied to the mechanism of an ordinary firefly algorithm (FA) without changing its structure. As a result, the implementation of the proposed algorithm is simple and straightforward.

Because Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks crucially depend on reasoning about latent mental states of oneself and others, such models are therefore often thought to fail at ToM. While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan & Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models. We further find that incorporating annealing, where the tempered distribution is gradually shifted from high to low temperature, substantially improves ToM performance over fixed-temperature power sampling.

Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities. However, new hardware optimizations in the form of Data Memory-dependent Prefetchers (DMP) present in Apple, Intel, and ARM CPUs have shown such defenses are not sufficient. These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.\n  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets. Rather than disable a DMP entirely, SplittingSecrets can provide targeted hardening for only specific secrets entirely in software.\n  We have implemented SplittingSecrets using LLVM, supporting both source-level memory operations and those generated by the compiler backend for the AArch64 architecture, We have analyzed the performance overhead involved in safeguarding secrets from DMP-induced attacks using common primitives in libsodium, a popular cryptographic library when built for Apple M-series CPUs."}

Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Technologies such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enable autonomous cars to generate and exchange substantial amounts of data with real-world entities, enhancing safety, improving performance, and delivering personalized user experiences. However, this data-driven ecosystem introduces significant challenges, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and governance. The absence of transparency and comprehensive regulatory frameworks exacerbates issues of unauthorized data access, prolonged retention, and potential misuse, creating tension between consumer benefits and privacy risks. This review paper explores the multifaceted nature of data sharing in CAVs, analyzing its contributions to innovation and its associated vulnerabilities. It evaluates data-sharing mechanisms and communication technologies, highlights the benefits of data exchange across various use cases, examines privacy concerns and risks of data misuse, and critically reviews regulatory frameworks and their inadequacies in safeguarding user privacy. By providing a thorough analysis of the current state of data sharing in the automotive sector, the paper emphasizes the urgent need for robust policies and ethical data management practices.

A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa. We also prove that, under certain data conditions, ERM solutions can achieve performance comparable to that of invariant prediction models. Secondly, the empirical validation results demonstrated that the predictions of learned models approximate those of Oracle or Optimal models, provided that the degree of distribution shift in the training data increases."}

While digital processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures promise to accelerate GEMV operations, existing PIM-equipped edge devices still suffer from three key limitations: limited bandwidth improvement, component under-utilization in mixed workloads, and low compute capacity of computing units (CUs). In this paper, we propose CD-PIM to address these challenges through three key innovations. First, we introduce a high-bandwidth compute-efficient mode (HBCEM) that enhances bandwidth by dividing each bank into four pseudo-banks through segmented global bitlines. Second, we propose a low-batch interleaving mode (LBIM) to improve component utilization by overlapping GEMV operations with GEMM operations. Third, we design a compute-efficient CU that performs enhanced GEMV operations in a pipelined manner by serially feeding weight data into the computing core. Forth, we adopt a column-wise mapping for the key-cache matrix and row-wise mapping for the value-cache matrix, which fully utilizes CU resources. Our evaluation shows that compared to a GPU-only baseline and state-of-the-art PIM designs, our CD-PIM achieves 11.42x and 4.25x speedup on average within a single batch in HBCEM mode, respectively. Moreover, for low-batch sizes, the CD-PIM achieves an average speedup of 1.12x in LBIM compared to HBCEM."}

Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, adopting various models to combine these embeddings into a sequence representation that captures user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Furthermore, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films within the genre facet), which are challenging to fully represent with static identifiers. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture titled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the final multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately, effectively capturing distinct item facets. A gating mechanism then integrates these predictions by dynamically determining their importance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network within each attention head to disentangle varied user preferences within each facet, utilizing a learnable router network to aggregate expert outputs based on context. Complementing this architecture, we design a Text-Enhanced Facet-Aware Pre-training module to overcome the limitations of randomly initialized embeddings. By utilizing a pre-trained text encoder and employing an alternating supervised contrastive learning objective, we explicitly disentangle facet-specific features from textual metadata (e.g., descriptions) before sequential training begins. This ensures that the item embeddings are semantically robust and aligned with the downstream multi-facet framework."}

This paper introduces Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model via Representation Decomposition (PCBM-ReD), a novel pipeline that retrofits interpretability onto pretrained opaque models. PCBM-ReD automatically extracts visual concepts from a pre-trained encoder, employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to label and filter concepts based on visual identifiability and task relevance, and selects an independent subset via reconstruction-guided optimization. Leveraging CLIP's visual-text alignment, it decomposes image representations into linear combination of concept embeddings to fit into the CBMs abstraction.

This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow.

This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.\n  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping."}

However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality.

Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research."}

However, existing detection methods generally suffer from overfitting to specific source models, leading to significant performance degradation when confronted with unseen generative architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cross-model detection framework called S 2 F-Net, whose core lies in exploring and leveraging the inherent spectral discrepancies between real and synthetic textures. Considering that upsampling operations leave unique and distinguishable frequency fingerprints in both texture-poor and texture-rich regions, we focus our research on the detection of frequency-domain artifacts, aiming to fundamentally improve the generalization performance of the model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable frequency attention module that adaptively weights and enhances discriminative frequency bands by synergizing spatial texture analysis and spectral dependencies.On the AIGCDetectBenchmark, which includes 17 categories of generative models, S 2 F-Net achieves a detection accuracy of 90.49%, significantly outperforming various existing baseline methods in cross-domain detection scenarios."}

Understanding music structure helps both perception and aesthetic education. Music structure incorporates a range of information, the coordination of which forms the melody, just as different military actions cooperate to produce a military strategy. However, there are a few ways for assessing music perception from the perspectives of system operation and information management. In this paper, we explore the similarities between music structure and military strategy while creating the Music Clips Correlation Network (MCCN) based on Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The inspiration comes from the comparison between a concert conductor's musical score and a military war commander's sand table exercise. Specifically, we create MCCNs for various kinds of war movie soundtracks, then relate military tactics (Sun Tzu's Art of War, etc.) and political institutions to military operations networks. Our primary findings suggest a few similarities, implying that music perception and aesthetic education can be approached from a military strategy and management perspective through this interdisciplinary research. Similarly, we can discover similarities between the art of military scheming and the art of musical structure based on network analysis in order to facilitate the understanding of the relationship between technology and art."}

However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

Moreover, most interventions situate learners as victims, overlooking that fraud encounters often involve multiple roles, such as bystanders who witness scams and helpers who support victims. To address this gap, we developed ROLESafe, an anti-fraud educational intervention in which older adults learn through different learning roles, including Experiencer (experiencing fraud), Helper (assisting a victim), and Observer (witnessing fraud). In a between-subjects study with 144 older adults in China, we found that the Experiencer and Helper roles significantly improved participants' ability to identify online fraud.

These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs."}

Existing methods primarily relt on two prior assumption: low-rank background and sparse anomaly, along with additional spatial assumptions of the background. However, most methods only utilize the sparsity prior assumption for anomalies and rarely expand on this hypothesis. From observations of hyperspectral images, we find that anomalous pixels exhibit certain spatial distribution characteristics: they often manifest as small, clustered groups in space, which we refer to as cluster sparsity of anomalies. Then, we combined the cluster sparsity prior with the classical GoDec algorithm, incorporating the cluster sparsity prior into the S-step of GoDec. This resulted in a new hyperspectral anomaly detection method, which we called Turbo-GoDec. In this approach, we modeled the cluster sparsity prior of anomalies using a Markov random field and computed the marginal probabilities of anomalies through message passing on a factor graph. Locations with high anomalous probabilities were treated as the sparse component in the Turbo-GoDec. Experiments are conducted on three real hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Turbo-GoDec method in detecting small-size anomalies comparing with the vanilla GoDec (LSMAD) and state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.

To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity.

By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains.

In this work, we present three algorithms for solving the most general form of the CCP, where coupons are collected under any arbitrary drawing probability, with the objective of obtaining $t$ copies of a subset of $k$ coupons from a total of $n$. The First algorithm provides the base model to compute the expectation, variance, and the second moment of the collection process. The second algorithm utilizes the construction of the base model and computes the same values in polynomial time with respect to $n$ under the uniform drawing distribution, and the third algorithm extends to any general drawing distribution. All algorithms leverage Markov models specifically designed to address computational challenges, ensuring exact computation of the expectation and variance of the collection process. Their implementation uses a dynamic programming approach that follows from the Markov models framework, and their time complexity is analyzed accordingly."}

However, existing LLM-based optimizers generalize poorly to the high-dimensional, structured CASH space. We propose LB-MCTS, a framework synergizing LLMs and BO within a Monte Carlo Tree Search structure. It maximizes LLM reasoning with Selective Tuning Memory (STM) and explicit exploration-exploitation trade-off.

However, a limitation of these approaches is their dependence on high-resolution input images to achieve optimal performance, which results in considerable computational overhead. In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark. We believe this framework provides a practical and efficient baseline for future research in semantic correspondence. Code is available at: https://github.com/hailong23-jin/SimpleMatch."}

Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of <3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats."}

Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 106 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 76 of which have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively."}

This motivates us to study the model checking problem for Hyper2LTL over finite structures -- tree-shaped or acyclic graphs, which are particularly useful for monitoring purposes. We show that Hyper2LTL model checking is decidable on finite structures. It is in PSPACE (in the size of the model) on tree-shaped models and in EXPSPACE on acyclic models.

Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset.

Crop segmentation is a fundamental task for modern agriculture, which closely relates to many downstream tasks such as plant phenotyping, density estimation, and weed control.

These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively).

We show that synthetic data reliably reproduces bias patterns observed in natural text, enabling large-scale analysis. Using this approach, we conduct the largest bias audit to date, comprising 1.9 billion data points across multiple entity types, tasks, languages, models, and prompting strategies. Our results reveal systematic biases: models penalize right-wing politicians, favor left-wing politicians, prefer Western and wealthy nations over the Global South, favor Western companies, and penalize firms in the defense and pharmaceutical sectors.

To address these issues, R-VoxelMap utilizes a geometry-driven recursive construction strategy based on an outlier detect-and-reuse pipeline. Specifically, for each voxel, accurate planes are first fitted while separating outliers using random sample consensus (RANSAC). The remaining outliers are then propagated to deeper octree levels for recursive processing, ensuring a detailed representation of the environment. In addition, a point distribution-based validity check algorithm is devised to prevent erroneous plane merging.

As a type of real-world data, the high-dimensional spectra in hyperspectral images are actually determined by only a few factors, such as chemical composition and illumination. Thus, spectra in hyperspectral images are highly likely to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Based on the hyperspectral manifold hypothesis, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method (named ScoreAD) that leverages the time-dependent gradient field of the data distribution (i.e., the score), as learned by a score-based generative model (SGM). Our method first trains the SGM on the entire set of spectra from the hyperspectral image. At test time, each spectrum is passed through a perturbation kernel, and the resulting perturbed spectrum is fed into the trained SGM to obtain the estimated score. The manifold hypothesis of HSIs posits that background spectra reside on one or more low-dimensional manifolds. Conversely, anomalous spectra, owing to their unique spectral signatures, are considered outliers that do not conform to the background manifold. Based on this fundamental discrepancy in their manifold distributions, we leverage a generative SGM to achieve hyperspectral anomaly detection. Experiments on the four hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/jiahuisheng/ScoreAD."}

This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a \"granularity gap\" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks.

Arvada and Treevada perform grammar inference directly on full-length input examples, which proves inefficient for large files commonly found in such languages. While Kedavra introduces data decomposition to create shorter examples for grammar inference, its lexical analysis still relies on the original inputs.

Tasks like multilingual transliteration, code refactoring, grammatical correction or text normalization often rely on local dependencies where the full modeling capacity of AR models can be overkill, creating a trade-off between their high accuracy and high inference latency. While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline. It maintains a competitive mean Character Error Rate of 15.78%, compared to 14.44% for the AR model and 21.88% for a standard NAR equivalent. Importantly, NADIR reduces Repetition errors by 49.53%, Substitution errors by 24.45%, Omission errors by 32.92%, and Insertion errors by 16.87%. This work provides a practical blueprint for building fast and reliable NAR systems, effectively bridging the gap between AR accuracy and the demands of real-time, large-scale deployment."}

This manuscript is currently under peer review", "summary": "Article 40(12) of the Digital Services Act (DSA) requires Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) to provide vetted researchers with access to publicly accessible data. While prior work has identified shortcomings of platform-provided data access mechanisms, existing research has not quantitatively assessed data quality and completeness in Research APIs across platforms, nor systematically mapped how current access provisions fall short. This paper presents a systematic audit of research access modalities by comparing data obtained through platform Research APIs with data collected about the same platforms' user-visible public information environment (PIE). Focusing on two major platform APIs, the TikTok Research API and the Meta Content Library, we reconstruct full information feeds for two controlled sockpuppet accounts during two election periods and benchmark these against the data retrievable for the same posts through the corresponding Research APIs. Our findings show systematic data loss through three classes of platform-imposed mechanisms: scope narrowing, metadata stripping, and operational restrictions. Together, these mechanisms implement overlapping filters that exclude large portions of the platform PIE (up to approximately 50 percent), strip essential contextual metadata (up to approximately 83 percent), and impose severe technical constraints for researchers (down to approximately 1000 requests per day). Viewed through a data quality lens, these filters primarily undermine completeness, resulting in a structurally biased representation of platform activity. We conclude that, in their current form, the Meta and TikTok Research APIs fall short of supporting meaningful, independent auditing of systemic risks as envisioned under the DSA."}

Using object size or latent feature, they then retrieve objects from a predefined database. For complex scenes of varied, multi-categorical objects, diffusion-based latents cannot be effectively decoded by current autoencoders into the correct point cloud objects which agree with target classes. We introduce a Class-Partitioned Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CPVQ-VAE) that is trained to effectively decode object latent features, by employing a pioneering $\\textit{class-partitioned codebook}$ where codevectors are labeled by class. To address the problem of $\\textit{codebook collapse}$, we propose a $\\textit{class-aware}$ running average update which reinitializes dead codevectors within each partition. During inference, object features and class labels, both generated by a Latent-space Flow Matching Model (LFMM) designed specifically for scene generation, are consumed by the CPVQ-VAE. The CPVQ-VAE's class-aware inverse look-up then maps generated latents to codebook entries that are decoded to class-specific point cloud shapes. Thereby, we achieve pure point cloud generation without relying on an external objects database for retrieval. Extensive experiments reveal that our method reliably recovers plausible point cloud scenes, with up to 70.4% and 72.3% reduction in Chamfer and Point2Mesh errors on complex living room scenes."}

However, existing models generally do not explicitly model seekers' emotion shifts across counseling sessions, a core focus in classical psychological schools. Moreover, how to align counselor models' responses with these emotion shifts while proactively mitigating safety risks remains underexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose PsychēChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that PsychēChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control."}

Focusing on binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, differential privacy (DP) is first studied under a deterministic phase rotation applied on the BPSK modulation at the transmitter, while the receiver is assumed to be unaware of the rotation angle. In this setting, privacy is achieved through an effective reduction in the decision distance, resulting in a controlled increase in the bit error rate (BER) without explicit noise injection. Next, a BPSK transmission scheme with intentionally induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) is studied, where the receiver is likewise unaware of the deterministic timing offset that generates the ISI. Unlike the rotated BPSK scheme, the DP obtained via ISI is shown to depend explicitly on the input data distribution. In particular, numerical results demonstrate that, for a fixed ISI parameter, the privacy loss is maximized when the binary input symbols are equiprobable. While conventional DP mechanisms rely on artificially added noise, often incurring additional energy or communication costs, it is shown that structured modifications, such as modulation rotation or induced ISI inherent to realistic communication channels can itself provide DP guarantees. While the analysis focuses on deterministic transmitter modifications unknown to the receiver, it is noted that real-world devices naturally introduce unintentional rotations or ISI due to hardware nonidealities and implementation errors. These effects can therefore provide a level of privacy without requiring explicit noise injection. Hence, it is possible to avoid deliberately perturbing the data, instead leveraging inherent device imperfections to achieve privacy guarantees with no additional privacy cost."}

We present VR2VR, a co-located dual VR-headset platform for HRI research in which a participant and a hidden operator share the same physical space while experiencing different virtual embodiments. The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body gestures, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked motion and face signals. Because the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also physically touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch aligned with the robot's hands; finger and hand motion are mapped to the robot using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb teleoperation, our VR2VR system supports experimental control by retargeting or selectively enabling nonverbal channels (e.g., head only vs. head+eyes vs. head+eyes+facial expressions) while keeping physical interaction constant. We detail the system design, calibration workflow, and safety considerations, and demonstrate the platform through a touch-based Wizard-of-Oz HRI study, illustrating how VR2VR lowers barriers for rapidly prototyping and rigorously evaluating embodied, touch-centric robot behaviors."}

Explainability was achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide global and individual-level interpretation of predictions.\n  Results: The model achieved modest discrimination (AUC = 0.61) with conservative calibration, underestimating risk at higher probability levels.

To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability."}

We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know.

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task.

However, existing mitigation strategies tend towards an image-centric interpretation of these imbalances, often prioritising increased image attention while giving less consideration to the roles of the other modalities. In this study, we evaluate a more holistic, system-mediated account, which attributes these imbalances to functionally redundant system weights that reduce attention to image and textual inputs. We show that this framework offers a useful empirical perspective on the yes-bias, a common form of hallucination in which VLMs indiscriminately respond 'yes'. Causally redistributing attention from the system modality to image and textual inputs substantially suppresses this bias, often outperforming existing approaches. We further present evidence suggesting that system-mediated attention imbalances contribute to the yes-bias by encouraging a default reliance on coarse input representations, which are effective for some tasks but ill-suited to others. Taken together, these findings firmly establish system attention as a key factor in VLM hallucination and highlight its potential as a lever for mitigation."}

Existing solutions use RGB cameras to annotate skeletal keypoints, but their performance declines in dark environments and raises privacy concerns, limiting their use in smart homes and hospitals. This paper explores non-invasive wireless sensors, i.e., LiDAR and mmWave, to mitigate these challenges as a feasible alternative. Two problems are addressed: (1) insufficient data on wireless sensor modality to train an accurate skeleton estimation model, and (2) skeletal keypoints derived from wireless sensors are noisier than RGB, causing great difficulties for subsequent action recognition models. Our work, SkeFi, overcomes these gaps through a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer method acquired from the data-rich RGB modality. We propose the enhanced Temporal Correlation Adaptive Graph Convolution (TC-AGC) with frame interactive enhancement to overcome the noise from missing or inconsecutive frames. Additionally, our research underscores the effectiveness of enhancing multiscale temporal modeling through dual temporal convolution. By integrating TC-AGC with temporal modeling for cross-modal transfer, our framework can extract accurate poses and actions from noisy wireless sensors. Experiments demonstrate that SkeFi realizes state-of-the-art performances on mmWave and LiDAR. The code is available at https://github.com/Huang0035/Skefi."}

In this paper, we develop a new framework that models reoffending risk as a human-system interaction, linking individual behavior with system-level dynamics and endogenous community feedback. Using an agent-based simulation calibrated to U.S. probation data, we evaluate treatment allocation policies under different capacity constraints and incarceration settings. Our results show that no single prioritization policy dominates. Instead, policy effectiveness depends on temporal windows and system parameters: prioritizing low-risk individuals performs better when long-term trajectories matter, while prioritizing high-risk individuals becomes more effective in the short term or when incarceration leads to shorter monitoring periods. These findings highlight the need to evaluate risk-based decision systems as sociotechnical systems with long-term accountability, rather than as isolated predictive tools."}

These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training. This survey reviews the latest advancements in adversarial defense strategies for VLMs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of such approaches and discussing ongoing challenges in enhancing the robustness of VLMs."}

The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \\log n) while maintaining (\\dparam, \\deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations.

Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates.

We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls.

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation."}

The resulting linear-Gaussian measurement model is learned in closed form from groundtruth training data, without iterative optimization or reliance on an explicit parametric sensor model. At inference, KILO-EKF performs a standard EKF update using Jacobians obtained via the learned lifting. We validate the approach on a real-world quadrotor localization task using an IMU, ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors, and a downward-facing laser. We compare against multiple EKF baselines with varying levels of sensor calibration. KILO-EKF achieves better accuracy and consistency compared to data-calibrated baselines, and significantly outperforms EKFs that rely on imperfect geometric models, while maintaining real-time inference and fast training.

To address these limitations, we developed a large-scale, multi-source benchmark for multi-organelle instance segmentation, comprising over 100,000 2D EM images across variety cell types and five organelle classes that capture real-world variability. Dataset annotations were generated by our designed connectivity-aware Label Propagation Algorithm (3D LPA) with expert refinement.

We identify the \"almost-there\" phenomenon in long-context reasoning, where trajectories are largely correct but fail at the final step, and attribute this failure to two factors: (1) the lack of high reasoning density in long-context QA data that push LLMs beyond mere grounding toward sophisticated multi-hop reasoning; and (2) the loss of valuable learning signals during long-context RL training due to the indiscriminate penalization of partially correct trajectories with incorrect outcomes. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose DeepReasonQA, a KG-driven synthesis framework that controllably constructs high-difficulty, multi-hop long-context QA pairs with inherent reasoning chains. Building on this, we introduce Long-context Process Advantage Shaping (LongPAS), a simple yet effective method that performs fine-grained credit assignment by evaluating reasoning steps along Validity and Relevance dimensions, which captures critical learning signals from \"almost-there\" trajectories.

In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines.

Each robot locally detects and describes individuals using a vision-language model (VLM), producing textual descriptions of appearance instead of feature vectors. These descriptions are compared and clustered across the swarm without centralized coordination, allowing robots to collaboratively group observations of the same individual. Each cluster is distilled into a representative description by a language model, providing an interpretable, concise summary of the swarm's collective perception. This approach enables natural-language querying, enhances transparency, and supports explainable swarm behavior. Preliminary experiments demonstrate competitive performance in identity consistency and interpretability compared to embedding-based methods, despite current limitations in text similarity and computational load.

In this work, we present a first multi-view-based method for high-fidelity 3D fur modeling of animals using a strand-based representation, leveraging the general knowledge of a vision language model. Given multi-view RGB images, we first reconstruct a coarse surface geometry using traditional multi-view stereo techniques. We then use a vision language model (VLM) system to retrieve information about the realistic length structure of the fur for each part of the body. We use this knowledge to construct the animal's furless geometry and grow strands atop it. The fur reconstruction is supervised with both geometric and photometric losses computed from multi-view images. To mitigate orientation ambiguities stemming from the Gabor filters that are applied to the input images, we additionally utilize the VLM to guide the strands' growth direction and their relation to the gravity vector that we incorporate as a loss.

This paper presents a multimodal wearable assistive system that integrates object detection with vision-language models to support independent product or item retrieval, with the goal of enhancing users'autonomy and sense of agency. The system operates through three phases: product search, which identifies target products using YOLO-World detection combined with embedding similarity and color histogram matching; product navigation, which provides spatialized sonification and VLM-generated verbal descriptions to guide users toward the target; and product correction, which verifies whether the user has reached the correct product and provides corrective feedback when necessary. Technical evaluation demonstrated promising performance across all modules, with product detection achieving near-perfect accuracy at close range and high accuracy when facing shelves within 1.5 m. VLM-based navigation achieved up to 94.4% accuracy, and correction accuracy exceeded 86% under optimal model configurations. These results demonstrate the system's potential to address the last-meter problem in assistive shopping. Future work will focus on user studies with pBLV participants and integration with multi-scale navigation ecosystems."}

Yet existing approaches remain fragmented across methodological paradigms, and it remains unclear which methods best capture community-specific notions of value. We introduce VASTU (Value-Aligned Social Toolkit for Online Content Curation), a benchmark and evaluation framework for systematically comparing approaches to detecting community-valued content. VASTU includes a dataset of 75,000 comments from 15 diverse Reddit communities, annotated with community approval labels and rich linguistic features. Using VASTU, we evaluate feature-based models, transformers, prompted and fine-tuned language models under global versus community-specific training regimes. We find that community-specific models consistently outperform global approaches, with fine-tuned transformers achieving the strongest performance (0.72 AUROC). Notably, fine-tuned SLMs (0.65 AUROC) substantially outperform prompted LLMs (0.60 AUROC) despite being 100 times smaller. Counterintuitively, chain-of-thought prompting provides no benefit, and reasoning models perform the worst (0.53 AUROC), suggesting this task requires learning community norms rather than test-time reasoning. By releasing VASTU, we provide a standardized benchmark to advance research on value-aligned sociotechnical systems."}

In this work, we introduce Histopath-C, a new benchmark with realistic synthetic corruptions designed to mimic real-world distribution shifts observed in digital histopathology. Our framework dynamically applies corruptions to any available dataset and evaluates Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) mechanisms on the fly. We then propose LATTE, a transductive, low-rank adaptation strategy that exploits multiple text templates, mitigating the sensitivity of histopathology VLMs to diverse text inputs.

Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

To address this limitation, we propose a flexible solution using moving drones to capture videos and perform video-level crowd counting and tracking of unique pedestrians across entire scenes. We introduce MovingDroneCrowd++, the largest video-level dataset for dense crowd counting and tracking captured by moving drones, covering diverse and complex conditions with varying flight altitudes, camera angles, and illumination. Existing methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this dataset. To this end, we propose GD3A (Global Density Map Decomposition via Descriptor Association), a density map-based video individual counting method that avoids explicit localization. GD3A establishes pixel-level correspondences between pedestrian descriptors across consecutive frames via optimal transport with an adaptive dustbin score, enabling the decomposition of global density maps into shared, inflow, and outflow components. Building on this framework, we further introduce DVTrack, which converts descriptor-level matching into instance-level associations through a descriptor voting mechanism for pedestrian tracking. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches under dense crowds and complex motion, reducing counting error by 47.4 percent and improving tracking performance by 39.2 percent."}

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized."}

We establish this by demonstrating that Resolution can simulate the correctness proof of a particular kind of reduction from 3-SAT to the parameterized clique problem. This also re-establishes the known conditional hardness result for $k$-clique which states that if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) holds, then the $k$-clique problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k)}$. Since it is known that the analogue of ETH holds for Resolution, unconditionally and with explicit hard instances, this gives a way to obtain explicit instances of $k$-clique that are unconditionally $n^{Ω(k)}$-hard to refute in Resolution.

A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code."}

We propose several improvements that address these fundamental challenges, namely, a Hessian regularization scheme that penalizes unphysical signatures in the Lagrangian's second derivatives with respect to velocities, preventing the network from learning unstable dynamics, activation functions that are better suited to the problem of learning Lagrangians, and a physics-aware coordinate scaling that improves stability. We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings. To deal with the relativistic setting, we extended our regularization to penalize violations of Lorentzian signatures, which allowed us to predict a geodesic Lagrangian under AdS\\textsubscript{4} spacetime metric directly from trajectory data, which to our knowledge has not been done in the literature before. This opens new possibilities for automated discovery of geometric structures in physics, including extraction of spacetime metric tensor components from geodesic trajectories.

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique.

However, achieving reliable navigation remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on artificial muscles integrated into the robot body or active tip-steering mechanisms. While effective, these additions introduce structural complexity and compromise the defining advantages of eversion robots: their inherent softness and compliance. In this paper, we propose a passive approach to reduce bending stiffness by purposefully introducing buckling points along the robot's outer wall. We achieve this by integrating inextensible diameter-reducing circumferential bands at regular intervals along the robot body facilitating forward motion through tortuous, obstacle cluttered paths. Rather than relying on active steering, our approach leverages the robot's natural interaction with the environment, allowing for smooth, compliant navigation. We present a Cosserat rod-based mathematical model to quantify this behavior, capturing the local stiffness reductions caused by the constricting bands and their impact on global bending mechanics. Experimental results demonstrate that these bands reduce the robot's stiffness when bent at the tip by up to 91 percent, enabling consistent traversal of 180 degree bends with a bending radius of as low as 25 mm-notably lower than the 35 mm achievable by standard eversion robots under identical conditions. The feasibility of the proposed method is further demonstrated through a case study in a colon phantom. By significantly improving maneuverability without sacrificing softness or increasing mechanical complexity, this approach expands the applicability of eversion robots in highly curved pathways, whether in relation to pipe inspection or medical procedures such as colonoscopy."}

However, deploying such collaboration at scale remains difficult when communication bandwidth is limited and no roadside infrastructure is available. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fully decentralized framework that enables vehicles to self organize into cooperative groups using only vehicle to vehicle communication. The approach decomposes the problem into two sequential game theoretic stages. In the first stage, vehicles form stable clusters by evaluating mutual sensing complementarity and motion coherence, and each cluster elects a coordinator. In the second stage, the coordinator guides its members to selectively transmit point cloud segments from perceptually salient regions through a non cooperative potential game, enabling efficient local fusion. Global scene understanding is then achieved by exchanging compact detection messages across clusters rather than raw sensor data. We design distributed algorithms for both stages that guarantee monotonic improvement of the system wide potential function. Comprehensive experiments on the CARLA-OpenCDA-NS3 co-simulation platform show that our method reduces communication overhead while delivering higher perception accuracy and wider effective coverage compared to existing baselines."}

Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + α)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(α^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points.

Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost. This allows our weights to be computed for high resolution meshes in under a minute, in contrast to potentially hours for both classical and neural methods. We preserve and extend properties of classical methods through feature space constraints and locality weighting. Our field representation allows for automatic detection of semantic symmetries, which we use to produce symmetry-preserving deformations. We show a proof-of-concept application which can produce deformations for meshes up to 1 million faces in real-time on a consumer-grade machine."}

However, most studies utilize specialized, high-resolution eye-tracking equipment, limiting the potential reach of findings. We investigate how eye movement can be used to predict multimodal markers of emotional expression from naturalistic, low-resolution videos. We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry."}

Our approach translates English into a target low-resource language and then back into English, using a combination of chrF++ and BLEU as the reward function on the reconstructed English sentences. Using the NLLB-MD dataset, we evaluate both the 600M and 1.3B parameter NLLB models and observe consistent improvements for the following languages: Central Aymara, Friulian, Wolof and Russian.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment."}

In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montréal Area (Québec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the prevailing practice and show clear potential to delay costly grid upgrades."}

However, the rise of GenAI is driving a fundamental transformation in how people produce, structure, and reuse information - one that these paradigms no longer fully capture. This transformation is analogous to the Neolithic Revolution, when societies shifted from hunting and gathering to cultivation. Generative technologies empower users to \"farm\" information by planting seeds in the form of prompts, cultivating workflows over time, and harvesting richly structured, relevant yields within their own plots, rather than foraging across others people's patches. In this perspectives paper, we introduce the notion of Information Farming as a conceptual framework and argue that it represents a natural evolution in how people engage with information. Drawing on historical analogy and empirical evidence, we examine the benefits and opportunities of information farming, its implications for design and evaluation, and the accompanying risks posed by this transition. We hypothesize that as GenAI technologies proliferate, cultivating information will increasingly supplant transient, patch-based foraging as a dominant mode of engagement, marking a broader shift in human-information interaction and its study."}

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($ε$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact."}

This study examines the temporal and spatial patterns of traffic collisions in Dubai, UAE, with a particular focus on collision severity. To this end, traffic collision records from November 2024 to June 2025 were analyzed to examine hourly, daily, and monthly variations in collision frequency and severity for both overall traffic collisions and pedestrian-related accidents. Temporal associations with severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V, while spatial patterns were analyzed using severity-weighted hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, complemented by inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The results show a clear temporal variation in overall collision frequency and severity, with higher collision frequencies during evening and nighttime periods with 44% higher probability of high-severity outcomes at night compared to the afternoon. On the other hand, pedestrian-related accidents showed a distinct temporal profile, characterized by higher occurrence during late-evening hours and relatively limited variation across days of the week and months. Spatial analysis identified statistically significant severity hotspots for overall collisions in the northern and northwestern parts of Dubai and along the Al Ain-Dubai Highway, while pedestrian severity hotspots were concentrated near industrial areas in the southwestern region. Several policy measures are proposed based on the findings including, reducing nighttime speed limits, enhancing automated enforcement, improving roadway lighting, and implementing pedestrian-focused treatments in statistically significant hotspots."}

Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence. We evaluate a diverse set of open and closed multilingual LLMs using a structured meaning generation task across nine languages, employing a carefully curated benchmark of 100 high-polysemy English words. Our findings reveal significant variation in semantic robustness across both models and languages, providing a principled ranking system for model comparison without requiring definitive causal attribution of error sources. We contribute both a scalable comparative benchmark for multilingual semantic evaluation and a rigorous validation pipeline$-$critical tools for developing more linguistically balanced AI systems."}

However, existing factual recall evaluations primarily assess fact retrieval in isolation, where the queried entity is explicitly named and the fact is requested directly. In natural language use, facts are often accessed through context, where the relevant entity is introduced only indirectly. In this work, we study contextually mediated factual recall, asking whether LLMs can reliably retrieve factual knowledge when the target entity is embedded in a naturalistic context rather than queried explicitly, across languages. We construct controlled prompts that preserve the underlying fact while introducing referential mediation through contextual sentences. To disentangle contextual effects from name-specific associations, we further compare performance using synthetic names and real names across languages. Evaluating multiple model families in five languages, we find that contextual mediation consistently degrades factual recall, with substantial variation across relations. Larger models are more robust to contextual mediation, exhibiting a reduced performance gap relative to direct queries, while the effect of real names and name origin is mixed and unsystematic. These findings highlight a gap between isolated factual recall and context-dependent language understanding in multilingual LLMs."}

The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability. These capabilities position our methods as promising tools for accelerating target triage, optimizing observation schedules, and maximizing scientific return for upcoming flagship missions such as HWO."}

Category-Partition proceeds in several steps, from the identification of so-called categories and choices, possibly constrained, which are subsequently used to form test frames, i.e., combinations of choices, and eventually test cases. This paper reports on an ongoing attempt to automate as many of those steps as possible, with graphical-user interface tool support. Specifically, the user interface allows the user to specify parameters as well as so-called environment variables, further specify categories and choices with optional constraints. Choices are provided with precise specifications with operations specific to their types (e.g., Boolean, Integer, Real, String). Then, the tool automates the construction of test frames, which are combinations of choices, according to alternative selection criteria, and the identification of input values for parameters and environment variables for these test frames, thereby producing test cases. The paper illustrates the capabilities of the tool with the use of nine different case studies."}

As a solution, we propose the \\texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm, which combines the classical quadratic formulation of the reconstruction error with a Cayley parameterization of rotations and least-squares optimization. The key component of the method is a deterministic selection of starting points based on an analysis of the reconstruction error for two canonical vectors, allowing costly solution-space search procedures to be avoided. Experimental validation is performed using data acquired also from high-resolution RGB cameras and very low-resolution thermal cameras in an integrated RGB--IR setup. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves practically the same projection accuracy as optimal \\texttt{SQPnP} and slightly higher than \\texttt{IPPE}, both prominent \\texttt{PnP-OpenCV} procedures. However, \\texttt{PnP-ProCay78} maintains a significantly simpler algorithmic structure. Moreover, the analysis of optimization trajectories in Cayley space provides an intuitive insight into the convergence process, making the method attractive also from a didactic perspective. Unlike existing PnP solvers, the proposed \\texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm combines projection error minimization with an analytically eliminated reconstruction-error surrogate for translation, yielding a hybrid cost formulation that is both geometrically transparent and computationally efficient."}

Classical Shannon entropy forbids a representation with zero joint entropy and positive marginal entropies: non-negativity of conditional entropy rules this out. Replacing Shannon with von Neumann entropy within the Baez Fritz Leinster Parzygnat categorical framework removes this obstruction and admits a well-defined origin: a globally pure state with maximally mixed marginals, selected up to local-unitary equivalence. At this LME origin, marginal-entropy conservation becomes a second-order geometric condition. Because the marginal-entropy sum is saturated termwise, the constraint gradient vanishes and first-order tangency is vacuous; admissible directions are selected by the kernel of the constraint Hessian, characterised by the marginal-preserving tangent space.\n  We derive the constrained gradient flow in the matrix exponential family and show that, as the origin is approached, the affine time parameter degenerates. This motivates an axiomatically distinguished reparametrisation, entropy time $t$, defined by $dH/dt = c$ for fixed constant $c>0$. In this parametrisation, the infinite affine-time approach to the boundary maps to a finite entropy-time interval. The constrained dynamics split into a symmetric dissipative component realising SEA and a reversible component represented as unitary evolution.\n  As in the classical game, marginal-entropy conservation is equivalent to conservation of a sum of local modular Hamiltonian expectations, a state-dependent \"modular energy\"; in Gibbs regimes where local modular generators become approximately parameter-invariant, this reduces to familiar fixed-energy constraints from nonequilibrium thermodynamics."}

SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure.

Our contributions sum up to triangulating human-agent-object identity as trans-embodiment in supporting life transitions."}

Refining the well-known equivalence of the DLS theorem to the axiom of dependent choice (DC) over classical base theories, our constructive approach allows for several finer logical decompositions: Just assuming countable choice (CC), the DLS theorem is equivalent to the conjunction of DC with a newly identified fragment of the excluded middle (LEM) that we call the blurred drinker paradox (BDP). Further without CC, the DLS theorem is equivalent to the conjunction of BDP with similarly blurred weakenings of DC and CC. Independently of their connection with the DLS theorem, we also study BDP and the blurred choice axioms on their own, for instance by showing that BDP is LEM without a contribution of Markov's principle and that blurred DC is DC without a contribution of CC. The paper is hyperlinked with an accompanying Coq development."}

Despite rapid growth in MedTech innovation and \"health-at-home\" ecosystems, the intersection of MedTech cybersecurity and technology-facilitated abuse remains critically under-examined. IPV survivors who rely on therapeutic devices encounter a qualitatively different threat environment from the external, technically sophisticated adversaries typically modeled in MedTech cybersecurity research. We address this gap through two complementary methods: (1) the development of hazard-integrated threat models that fuse Cyber physical system security modeling with tech-abuse frameworks, and (2) an immersive simulation with practitioners, deploying a live version of our model, identifying gaps in digital forensic practice.\n  Our hazard-integrated CIA threat models map exploits to acute and chronic biological effects, uncovering (i) Integrity attack pathways that facilitate \"Medical gaslighting\" and \"Munchausen-by-IoMT\", (ii) Availability attacks that create life-critical and sub-acute harms (glycaemic emergencies, blindness, mood destabilization), and (iii) Confidentiality threats arising from MedTech advertisements (geolocation tracking from BLE broadcasts). Our simulation demonstrates that these attack surfaces are unlikely to be detected in practice: participants overlooked MedTech, misclassified reproductive and assistive technologies, and lacked awareness of BLE broadcast artifacts. Our findings show that MedTech cybersecurity in IPV contexts requires integrated threat modeling and improved forensic capabilities for detecting, preserving and interpreting harms arising from compromised patient-technology ecosystems."}

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence.

Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization."}

LLM-based agents bridge this gap due to their ability to call external resources and tools and thus are now rapidly gaining popularity. However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs. We describe the framework here in full, including a proof-of-concept system we built to accelerate the study of Catalysts, which is highly important in the field of Chemistry and Material Science. We report the cost to operate and use this framework, including the breakdown of the cost by services use. We also evaluate our system on a custom-curated synthetic benchmark and a popular Chemistry benchmark, and also perform expert validation of the system. The results show that our system is able to route the task to the correct agent 90% of the time and successfully complete the assigned task 97.5% of the time for the synthetic tasks and 91% of the time for real-world tasks, while still achieving better or comparable accuracy to most frontier models, showing that this is a viable framework for other scientific domains to replicate."}

Grounded in digital storytelling theory, we explore the motivations, expression, and sharing of PwD-created GenAI story videos. We conclude with a framework of momentous depiction, which highlights four core affordances of GenAI that either facilitate or require improvements to better support disability storytelling: non-capturable depiction, identity concealment and representation, contextual realism and consistency, and emotional articulation. Based on this framework, we further discuss design implications for GenAI in relation to story completion, media formats, and corrective mechanisms."}

With the rise of generative AI, fully automated and human-AI workflows have emerged as promising methods for analysis. However, methodological standards to guide such workflows remain limited. In this study, we propose that reasoning traces generated by large language model (LLM) agents, especially within multi-agent systems, constitute a novel and rich form of process data to enhance interpretive practices in qualitative coding. We apply cosine similarity to LLM reasoning traces to systematically detect, quantify, and interpret disagreements among agents, reframing disagreement as a meaningful analytic signal. Analyzing nearly 10,000 instances of agent pairs coding human tutoring dialog segments, we show that LLM agents' semantic reasoning similarity robustly differentiates consensus from disagreement and correlates with human coding reliability. Qualitative analysis guided by this metric reveals nuanced instructional sub-functions within codes and opportunities for conceptual codebook refinement. By integrating quantitative similarity metrics with qualitative review, our method has the potential to improve and accelerate establishing inter-rater reliability during coding by surfacing interpretive ambiguity, especially when LLMs collaborate with humans. We discuss how reasoning-trace disagreements represent a valuable new class of analytic signals advancing methodological rigor and interpretive depth in educational research."}

This formulation is equivalent to computing a minimum Moore machine consistent with observations along its runs. We show that the problem is NP-hard to approximate when the sample set consists of all prefixes of binary strings. Furthermore, we show that the problem remains NP-hard as a decision problem even when the sample set consists of the prefixes of a single binary string.

In this work, we introduce a float-coded, penalty-driven single-objective evolutionary framework for UAP generation that achieves lower visibility perturbations while enhancing attack success rates. Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures. Additionally, we ensure the universality of the generated perturbations by testing across diverse models and by periodically switching batches to prevent overfitting. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently produces perturbations with smaller norms, higher misclassification effectiveness, and faster convergence compared to existing evolutionary-based methods.

We postulate that visual/geometrical and textual representations of spatial structure must be combined at some point in VLM computations. We search for such confluence, and ask whether the identified representation can causally explain aspects of input-output model behavior through a linear model. We show empirically that VLMs encode object locations by linearly binding \\textit{spatial IDs} to textual activations, then perform reasoning via language tokens. Through rigorous causal interventions we demonstrate that these IDs, which are ubiquitous across the model, can systematically mediate model beliefs at intermediate VLM layers. Additionally, we find that spatial IDs serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying limitations in existing VLMs, and as a valuable learning signal. We extend our analysis to video VLMs and identify an analogous linear temporal ID mechanism. By characterizing our proposed spatiotemporal ID mechanism, we elucidate a previously underexplored internal reasoning process in VLMs, toward improved interpretability and the principled design of more aligned and capable models.

The dataset includes 33 technology-focused, 14 climate-focused, and 7 COVID-related aggregated agents, encompassing around one million posts and comments. Using publicly available posts and comments, we define agent categories based on content and interaction patterns, derive inter-agent relationships from temporal commenting behaviors, and build a directed, weighted network that reflects empirically observed user connections. The resulting dataset enables researchers to calibrate and benchmark agent behavior, network structure, and information diffusion processes against real social dynamics. Our quantitative analysis reveals clear topic-dependent differences in how users interact. Climate discussions show dense, highly connected networks with sustained engagement, COVID-related interactions are sparse and mostly one-directional, and technology discussions are organized around a small number of central hubs. Manual qualitative analysis further shows that agent interactions follow realistic patterns of timing, similarity between users, and sentiment change."}

They also carry increasing risk of data leakage due to overlap with model pretraining corpora and often overlook critical dimensions such as robustness to linguistic variation and potential demographic biases.\n  Materials and Methods: To address these gaps, we introduce BioPulse-QA, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on answering questions from newly published biomedical documents including drug labels, trial protocols, and clinical guidelines. BioPulse-QA includes 2,280 expert-verified question answering (QA) pairs and perturbed variants, covering both extractive and abstractive formats. We evaluate four LLMs - GPT-4o, GPT-o1, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct - released prior to the publication dates of the benchmark documents.\n  Results: GPT-o1 achieves the highest relaxed F1 score (0.92), followed by Gemini-2.0-Flash (0.90) on drug labels. Clinical trials are the most challenging source, with extractive F1 scores as low as 0.36.\n  Discussion and Conclusion: Performance differences are larger for paraphrasing than for typographical errors, while bias testing shows negligible differences.

We analyze 434 apps drawn from official registries and app markets from Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. To operationalize policy requirements at scale, we translate policy text into testable permission checks using LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping and combine this with static and dynamic analyses of loan apps' code and runtime behavior.\n  Our findings reveal pervasive non-compliance among approved apps: 141 violate national regulatory policy and 147 violate Google policy. Dynamic analysis further shows that several apps transmit sensitive data (contacts, SMS, location, media) before user signup or registration, undermining informed consent and enabling downstream harassment of borrowers and third parties. Following our disclosures, Google removed 93 flagged apps from Google Play, representing over 300M cumulative installs.\n  We advocate for adopting our methodology as a proactive compliance-monitoring tool and offer targeted recommendations for regulators, platforms, and developers to strengthen privacy protections.

We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks.

Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively."}

Across closed-form reasoning and open-ended generation tasks, we find that objective choice induces systematic, scale-dependent shifts along the safety-capability frontier. At small training budgets, robustness is similar across objectives but capability differs. At larger budgets, objectives diverge sharply: supervised and preference-based tuning tightly couple capability gains to increased adversarial vulnerability and persona drift, while objectives that constrain learning signals -- especially ORPO and KL-regularization -- substantially mitigate both. Fine-tuning objectives therefore matter little for safety at small scales but become a primary driver of adversarial robustness and latent persona stability as training scale increases."}

To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy.

While ex-ante harm identification and prevention have advanced, Responsible AI scholarship remains underdeveloped in addressing ex-post liability. Core legal questions regarding liability allocation, responsibility attribution, and remedial effectiveness remain insufficiently theorized and institutionalized, particularly for transboundary harms and risks that transcend national jurisdictions. Drawing on contemporary AI risk analyses, we argue that such harms are structurally embedded in global AI supply chains and are likely to escalate in frequency and severity due to cross-border deployment, data infrastructures, and uneven national oversight capacities. Consequently, territorially bounded liability regimes are increasingly inadequate. Using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this paper examines compensation and liability frameworks from high-risk transnational domains - including vaccine injury schemes, systemic financial risk governance, commercial nuclear liability, and international environmental regimes - to distill transferable legal design principles such as strict liability, risk pooling, collective risk-sharing, and liability channelling, while highlighting potential structural constraints on their application to AI-related harms. Situated within an international order shaped more by AI arms race dynamics than cooperative governance, the paper outlines the contours of a global AI accountability and compensation architecture, emphasizing the tension between geopolitical rivalry and the collective action required to govern transboundary AI risks effectively."}

This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can automate procedural case log documentation directly from free-text radiology reports.

Current benchmarks predominantly focus on public safety and Western cultural norms, leaving a critical gap in evaluating the niche, high-risk domain of medical ethics within the Chinese context. Objective: To establish a specialized jailbreak evaluation framework for Chinese medical ethics and to systematically assess the defensive resilience and ethical alignment of seven prominent LLMs when subjected to sophisticated adversarial simulations. Methodology: We evaluated seven prominent models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4-Reasoning, DeepSeek-R1) using a \"role-playing + scenario simulation + multi-turn dialogue\" vector within the DeepInception framework. The testing focused on eight high-risk themes, including commercial surrogacy and organ trading, utilizing a hierarchical scoring matrix to quantify the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and ASR Gain. Results: A systemic collapse of defenses was observed, whereas models demonstrated high baseline compliance, the jailbreak ASR reached 82.1%, representing an ASR Gain of over 80 percentage points. Claude-Sonnet-4-Reasoning emerged as the most robust model, while five models including Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-4.1 exhibited near-total failure with ASRs between 96% and 100%. Conclusions: Current LLMs are highly vulnerable to contextual manipulation in medical ethics, often prioritizing \"helpfulness\" over safety constraints. To enhance security, we recommend a transition from outcome to process supervision, the implementation of multi-factor identity verification, and the establishment of cross-model \"joint defense\" mechanisms."}

We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

To bridge this gap, we propose MedConsultBench, a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the complete online consultation cycle by covering the entire clinical workflow from history taking and diagnosis to treatment planning and follow-up Q\\&A. Our methodology introduces Atomic Information Units (AIUs) to track clinical information acquisition at a sub-turn level, enabling precise monitoring of how key facts are elicited through 22 fine-grained metrics.

Systematic evaluation of 19 large language models reveals that high diagnostic accuracy often masks significant deficiencies in information-gathering efficiency and medication safety.

This necessitates a focus on energy in space: spacecraft power systems (SPS), especially their health management (HM), given their role in power supply and high failure rates. Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making.

Existing solutions including safety-critical scenario generation and closed-loop learning often rely on rule-based heuristics, resampling methods and generative models learned from offline datasets, limiting their ability to produce diverse and novel challenges. While recent works leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce scene descriptions that guide a separate, downstream model in generating hazardous trajectories for agents, such two-stage framework constrains the generative potential of VLMs, as the diversity of the final trajectories is ultimately limited by the generalization ceiling of the downstream algorithm. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VILTA (VLM-In-the-Loop Trajectory Adversary), a novel framework that integrates a VLM into the closed-loop training of AD agents. Unlike prior works, VILTA actively participates in the training loop by comprehending the dynamic driving environment and strategically generating challenging scenarios through direct, fine-grained editing of surrounding agents' future trajectories. This direct-editing approach fully leverages the VLM's powerful generalization capabilities to create a diverse curriculum of plausible yet challenging scenarios that extend beyond the scope of traditional methods. We demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the safety and robustness of the resulting AD policy, particularly in its ability to navigate critical long-tail events."}

The invariant density satisfies the steady-state Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. We reformulate this equation in terms of its score function (the gradient of the log-density), which is estimated directly from data via denoising score matching, thereby bypassing explicit density estimation. This learned score is then embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct the drift velocity field under the resulting score-based FP equation. The mesh-free nature of PINNs allows the framework to scale to higher dimensions, avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in mesh-based methods. To address the ill-posedness of high-dimensional inverse problems, we recast the problem as a PDE-constrained optimization that seeks the minimal-energy velocity field. Under suitable conditions, we prove that this problem admits a unique solution that depends continuously on the score function. The constrained formulation is solved using a stochastic augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical experiments on representative dynamical systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, an active swimmer in an anharmonic trap, and the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems, demonstrate that PINN-IMSM accurately recovers invariant measures and reconstructs faithful dynamical behavior for problems in up to five dimensions."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains, containing 155 tools and 9,377 question-answer pairs, which simulates realistic integration scenarios. Additionally, we propose MetaToolAgent (MTA), a meta-learning approach designed to improve cross-tool generalization.

However, most existing architectures employ a decoupled pipeline: long sequences are first compressed with a query-token based sequence compressor like LONGER, followed by fusion with dense features through token-mixing modules like RankMixer, which thereby limits both the representation capacity and the interaction flexibility. This paper presents HyFormer, a unified hybrid transformer architecture that tightly integrates long-sequence modeling and feature interaction into a single backbone. From the perspective of sequence modeling, we revisit and redesign query tokens in LRMs, and frame the LRM modeling task as an alternating optimization process that integrates two core components: Query Decoding which expands non-sequential features into Global Tokens and performs long sequence decoding over layer-wise key-value representations of long behavioral sequences; and Query Boosting which enhances cross-query and cross-sequence heterogeneous interactions via efficient token mixing. The two complementary mechanisms are performed iteratively to refine semantic representations across layers. Extensive experiments on billion-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that HyFormer consistently outperforms strong LONGER and RankMixer baselines under comparable parameter and FLOPs budgets, while exhibiting superior scaling behavior with increasing parameters and FLOPs. Large-scale online A/B tests in high-traffic production systems further validate its effectiveness, showing significant gains over deployed state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of HyFormer as a unified modeling framework for industrial LRMs."}

To suppress thermal radiation and heat haze using fusion-restoration image processing methods, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of DIC in the measurement of high-temperature deformation. For image degradation caused by thermal radiation, based on the image layered representation, the image is decomposed into positive and negative channels for parallel processing, and then optimized for quality by multi-exposure image fusion. To counteract the high-frequency, random errors introduced by heat haze, we adopt the FSIM as the objective function to guide the iterative optimization of model parameters, and the grayscale average algorithm is applied to equalize anomalous gray values, thereby reducing measurement error. The proposed multi-exposure image fusion algorithm effectively suppresses image degradation caused by complex illumination conditions, boosting the effective computation area from 26% to 50% for under-exposed images and from 32% to 40% for over-exposed images without degrading measurement accuracy in the experiment. Meanwhile, the image restoration combined with the grayscale average algorithm reduces static thermal deformation measurement errors. The error in ε_xx is reduced by 85.3%, while the errors in ε_yy and γ_xy are reduced by 36.0% and 36.4%, respectively.

Using data from Reddit's ChangeMyView subreddit, where successful persuasion is explicitly signaled through the awarding of deltas, we analyze one-on-one exchanges and characterize participants' value expression by drawing from Schwartz's Refined Theory of Basic Human Values. We find that successful persuasion is associated with two complementary processes: pre-existing compatibility between participants' value priorities even before the exchange happens, and the emergence of value alignment over the course of a conversation. At the same time, successful persuasion does not depend on commenters making large departures from their typical value expression patterns. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of online social platforms that aim to support constructive engagement across disagreement."}

TEM prunes low-utility tokens, reducing encoder complexity and latency on edge hardware, while aggregated updates mitigate non-IID data heterogeneity across clients. To address challenge (3), BlockSecRT-DETR incorporates a decentralized blockchain-secured update validation mechanism that enables tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and trust-free authenticated model aggregation without relying on a central server. We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5). The blockchain integration adds 400 ms per round, and the ledger size remains under 12 KB due to metadata-only on-chain storage."}

Moreover, most guardian models rely on rigid, predefined safety categories that fail to generalize across diverse linguistic and sociocultural contexts. Robust safety, therefore, requires flexible, runtime-enforceable policies and benchmarks that reflect local norms, harm scenarios, and cultural expectations. We introduce UbuntuGuard, the first African policy-based safety benchmark built from adversarial queries authored by 155 domain experts across sensitive fields, including healthcare. From these expert-crafted queries, we derive context-specific safety policies and reference responses that capture culturally grounded risk signals, enabling policy-aligned evaluation of guardian models. We evaluate 13 models, comprising six general-purpose LLMs and seven guardian models across three distinct variants: static, dynamic, and multilingual. Our findings reveal that existing English-centric benchmarks overestimate real-world multilingual safety, cross-lingual transfer provides partial but insufficient coverage, and dynamic models, while better equipped to leverage policies at inference time, still struggle to fully localize African-language contexts. These findings highlight the urgent need for multilingual, culturally grounded safety benchmarks to enable the development of reliable and equitable guardian models for low-resource languages.

Although compiler optimizations and hand-written kernels can partially alleviate this issue, achieving near-hardware-limit performance still relies heavily on manual code refactoring and parameter tuning. Recent progress in LLM-agent-based kernel generation and optimization has been reported, yet many approaches primarily focus on direct code rewriting, where parameter choices are often implicit and hard to control, or require human intervention, leading to unstable performance gains. This paper introduces a template-based rewriting layer on top of an agent-driven iterative loop: kernels are semantically refactored into explicitly parameterizable templates, and template parameters are then optimized via search-based autotuning, yielding more stable and higher-quality speedups. Experiments on a set of real-world kernels demonstrate speedups exceeding 3x in the best case. We extract representative CUDA kernels from SGLang as evaluation targets; the proposed agentic tuner iteratively performs templating, testing, analysis, and planning, and leverages profiling feedback to execute constrained parameter search under hardware resource limits. Compared to agent-only direct rewriting, the template-plus-search design significantly reduces the randomness of iterative optimization, making the process more interpretable and enabling a more systematic approach toward high-performance configurations. The proposed method can be further extended to OpenCL, HIP, and other backends to deliver automated performance optimization for real production workloads."}

This paper studies a variant, HPP with Probabilistic Terminals (HPP-PT), where each vertex has a probability representing the likelihood that the robot's path terminates there, and the objective is to minimize the expected path cost. HPP-PT arises in target object search, where a mobile robot must visit all candidate locations to find an object, and prior knowledge of the object's location is expressed as vertex probabilities. While routing problems have been studied for decades, few of them consider uncertainty as required in this work. The challenge lies not only in optimally ordering the vertices, as in standard HPP, but also in handling history dependency: the expected path cost depends on the order in which vertices were previously visited. This makes many existing methods inefficient or inapplicable. To address the challenge, we propose a search-based approach RPT* with solution optimality guarantees, which leverages dynamic programming in a new state space to bypass the history dependency and novel heuristics to speed up the computation. Building on RPT*, we design a Hierarchical Autonomous Target Search (HATS) system that combines RPT* with either Bayesian filtering for lifelong target search with noisy sensors, or autonomous exploration to find targets in unknown environments. Experiments in both simulation and real robot show that our approach can naturally balance between exploitation and exploration, thereby finding targets more quickly on average than baseline methods."}

Theoretically, we show that susceptibilities decompose as a sum over modes of the data distribution, explaining why tokens that follow their contexts \"for similar reasons\" cluster together in susceptibility space. Empirically, we apply this methodology to Pythia-14M, developing a conductance-based clustering algorithm that identifies 510 interpretable clusters ranging from grammatical patterns to code structure to mathematical notation. Comparing to sparse autoencoders, 50% of our clusters match SAE features, validating that both methods recover similar structure."}

We extend postcolonial computing by introducing the idea of \"diasporic superposition,\" which shows how diasporas can exercise political and economic influence from hybrid positionalities that both contest and complicate power asymmetries.

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series."}

Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning.

Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar."}

This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic?\n  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications."}

To address these challenges, we propose DC-VLAQ, a representation-centric framework that integrates the fusion of complementary VFMs and robust global aggregation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight residual-guided complementary fusion that anchors representations in the DINOv2 feature space while injecting complementary semantics from CLIP through a learned residual correction. In addition, we propose the Vector of Local Aggregated Queries (VLAQ), a query--residual global aggregation scheme that encodes local tokens by their residual responses to learnable queries, resulting in improved stability and the preservation of fine-grained discriminative cues. Extensive experiments on standard VPR benchmarks, including Pitts30k, Tokyo24/7, MSLS, Nordland, SPED, and AmsterTime, demonstrate that DC-VLAQ consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts and long-term appearance changes."}

With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off.

In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation."}

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) serves as the de facto standard for describing REST APIs and is crucial for multiple software engineering tasks. However, developers face challenges in writing and maintaining OAS. Although static analysis shows potential for OAS generation, it is limited to specific programming languages and development frameworks. The powerful code understanding capabilities of LLMs offer new opportunities for OAS generation, yet they are constrained by context limitations and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose the OpenAI OpenAPI Project Scanner (OOPS), the first technology-agnostic LLM-based static analysis method for OAS generation, requiring fewer technology-specific rules and less human expert intervention. OOPS is implemented as an LLM agent workflow comprising two key steps: endpoint method extraction and OAS generation. By constructing an API dependency graph, it establishes necessary file associations to address LLMs' context limitations. Through multi-stage generation and self-refine, it mitigates both syntactic and semantic hallucinations during OAS generation. We evaluated OOPS on 12 real-world REST APIs spanning 5 programming languages and 8 development frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that OOPS accurately generates high-quality OAS for REST APIs implemented with diverse technologies, achieving an average F1-score exceeding 98% for endpoint method inference, 97% for both request parameter and response inference, and 92% for parameter constraint inference.

To address this, we harness the pre-trained 3D prior of LRM and incorporate FLAME-based 2D Gaussian Splatting into LRM's rendering pipeline. Specifically, KaoLRM projects LRM's pre-trained triplane features into the FLAME parameter space to recover geometry, and models appearance via 2D Gaussian primitives that are tightly coupled to the FLAME mesh. The rich prior enables the FLAME regressor to be aware of the 3D structure, leading to accurate and robust reconstructions under self-occlusions and diverse viewpoints.

Here, we introduce TreeWriter, a hierarchical writing system that represents documents as trees and integrates contextual AI support. TreeWriter allows authors to create, save, and refine document outlines at multiple levels, facilitating drafting, understanding, and iterative editing of long documents. A built-in AI agent can dynamically load relevant content, navigate the document hierarchy, and provide context-aware editing suggestions. A within-subject study (N=12) comparing TreeWriter with Google Docs + Gemini on long-document editing and creative writing tasks shows that TreeWriter improves idea exploration/development, AI helpfulness, and perceived authorial control.

One popular proof strategy derives valid inequalities by first proving inequalities in a labelled variant of flag algebra and then transferring them to the original unlabelled setting using the so-called downward operator. We explain this strategy in detail and highlight that its transfer mechanism relies on the notion of what we call an adjoint pair, reminiscent of Galois connections and categorical adjunctions, which appear frequently in work on automated verification and programming languages.

They also lack a unified mechanism to balance semantic guidance with motion efficiency in large-scale environments. To address these challenges, we present AirHunt, an aerial object navigation system that efficiently locates open-set objects with zero-shot generalization in outdoor environments by seamlessly fusing VLM semantic reasoning with continuous path planning. AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments further validate AirHunt's practical capability in complex and challenging environments. Code and dataset will be made publicly available before publication."}

Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini.

In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of \"pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning\" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning \"pre-training\" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer (SSPFormer) for MRI images, which effectively learns domain-specific feature representations of medical images by leveraging unlabeled raw imaging data. To tackle the domain gap and data scarcity, we introduce inverse frequency projection masking, which prioritizes the reconstruction of high-frequency anatomical regions to enforce structure-aware representation learning. Simultaneously, to enhance robustness against real-world MRI artifacts, we employ frequency-weighted FFT noise enhancement that injects physiologically realistic noise into the Fourier domain. Together, these strategies enable the model to learn domain-invariant and artifact-robust features directly from raw scans. Through extensive experiments on segmentation, super-resolution, and denoising tasks, the proposed SSPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, fully verifying its ability to capture fine-grained MRI image fidelity and adapt to clinical application requirements."}

However, collaborative perception often suffers from high communication overhead due to redundant data transmission, as well as increasing computation latency caused by excessive load with growing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) participation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel local-to-global collaborative perception framework (LGCP) to achieve collaboration in a communication- and computation-efficient manner. The road of interest is partitioned into non-overlapping areas, each of which is assigned a dedicated CAV group to perform localized perception. A designated leader in each group collects and fuses perception data from its members, and uploads the perception result to the roadside unit (RSU), establishing a link between local perception and global awareness. The RSU aggregates perception results from all groups and broadcasts a global view to all CAVs. LGCP employs a centralized scheduling strategy via the RSU, which assigns CAV groups to each area, schedules their transmissions, aggregates area-level local perception results, and propagates the global view to all CAVs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LGCP framework achieves an average 44 times reduction in the amount of data transmission, while maintaining or even improving the overall collaborative performance."}

To overcome the constant-factor optimality loss inherent to earlier literature, and to circumvent intrinsic representational barriers of adaptive policies, our approach is driven by the following innovations:\n  -- The block-responsive paradigm: We introduce block-responsive policies, a new class of decision-making strategies, selecting ordered sets (blocks) of applicants rather than single individuals, while still allowing for internal reactivity.\n  -- Adaptivity and efficiency: We prove that these policies can nearly match the performance of general adaptive policies while utilizing polynomially-sized decision trees.\n  -- Efficient construction: By developing a recursive enumeration-based framework, we resolve the problematic ``few-positions'' regime, bypassing a fundamental hurdle that hindered previous approaches."}

To overcome this challenge, we propose Debiased Source-free Object Detection (DSOD), a novel VFM-assisted SFOD framework that can effectively mitigate source bias with the help of powerful VFMs. Specifically, we propose Unified Feature Injection (UFI) module that integrates VFM features into the CNN backbone through Simple-Scale Extension (SSE) and Domain-aware Adaptive Weighting (DAAW). Then, we propose Semantic-aware Feature Regularization (SAFR) that constrains feature learning to prevent overfitting to source domain characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a VFM-free variant, termed DSOD-distill for computation-restricted scenarios through a novel Dual-Teacher distillation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DSOD outperforms state-of-the-art SFOD methods, achieving 48.1% AP on Normal-to-Foggy weather adaptation, 39.3% AP on Cross-scene adaptation, and 61.4% AP on Synthetic-to-Real adaptation."}

To facilitate efficient animation control, we model 3D head avatars with Gaussian primitives embedded on the surface of a parametric face model within the UV space. To obtain knowledge of full-head geometry and textures, we leverage rich 3D full-head priors within a pretrained 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) for global full-head feature extraction and multi-view supervision. To increase the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction of the input image, we take advantage of the symmetric nature of the UV space and human faces to fuse local fine-grained input image features with the global full-head textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving high-quality 3D full-head modeling as well as real-time animation, thereby improving the realism of 3D talking avatars."}

Nationality and region prediction tasks require understanding of not only linguistic features but also cultural and historical background, making LLM world knowledge particularly valuable. However, conventional LLM prompting methods rely on direct reasoning approaches, which have limitations in applying abstract linguistic rules. We propose LLM Associative Memory Agents (LAMA), a novel framework that leverages LLM world knowledge as associative memory. Rather than directly inferring nationality from names, LAMA recalls famous individuals with the same name and aggregates their nationalities through indirect reasoning. A dual-agent architecture comprising a Person Agent and a Media Agent, specialized in different knowledge domains, recalls famous individuals in parallel, generating Top-1 predictions through voting and Top-K predictions through conditional completion. On a 99-country nationality prediction task, LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy, substantially outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods and neural models. Our experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit higher reliability in recalling concrete examples than in abstract reasoning, that recall-based approaches are robust to low-frequency nationalities independent of data frequency distributions, and that the dual-agent architecture functions complementarily to produce synergistic effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a new multi-agent system that retrieves and aggregates LLM knowledge rather than prompting reasoning."}

The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions. These results indicate that the proposed model delivers more accurate short-term forecasts and improved representation of multi-scale ocean dynamics, thereby highlighting its potential to advance data-driven, eddy-resolving global ocean forecasting."}

Moreover, this approach preserves the original energy exactly at both the continuous and discrete levels, as opposed to a modified energy preserved by the auxiliary variable methods. Rigorous proofs are provided for the energy conservation and numerical accuracy of all derived schemes. The trade-off for these advantages is the need to solve a nonlinear algebraic equation to determine the Lagrange multiplier.

In this work, we propose RetCLIP, a retrieval-augmented panoptic segmentation method that improves the performance of unseen classes. In particular, we construct a masked segment feature database using paired image-text data. At inference time, we use masked segment features from the input image as query keys to retrieve similar features and associated class labels from the database. Classification scores for the masked segment are assigned based on the similarity between query features and retrieved features. The retrieval-based classification scores are combined with CLIP-based scores to produce the final output. We incorporate our solution with a previous SOTA method (FC-CLIP).

First, we establish precise bounds on the minimum rank distance of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes under two distinct parameter regimes. Specifically, when $n_{1}=k_{1}$ and $n_{2}=m<n_{1}n_{2}$, the minimum rank distance is exactly $n_{2}-k_{2}+1$. This yields a new family of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes, which are distinct from classical Gabidulin codes. For the case of $k_{1}\\leq n_{1},k_{2}\\leq n_{2},n_{1}n_{2}\\leq m$, the minimum rank distance $d$ of Gabidulin-Kronecker product codes satisfies a tight upper and lower bound, i.e., $n_{2}-k_{2}+1 \\leq d \\leq (n_{1}-k_{1}+1)(n_{2}-k_{2}+1)$. Second, we introduce a new class of decodable rank-metric codes, namely Extended Gabidulin-Kronecker product (EGK) codes, which generalize the structure of Gabidulin-Kronecker product (GK) codes. We also propose a decoding algorithm that directly retrieves the codeword without recovering the error vector, thus improving efficiency. This algorithm achieves zero decoding failure probability when the error weight is within its correction capability. Third, we propose three enhanced variants of the RQC cryptosystem based on EGK codes, each offering a distinct trade-off between security and efficiency. For 128-bit security, all variants achieve significant reductions in public key size compared to the Multi-UR-AG (Bidoux et.al., IEEE IT, 2024) while ensuring zero decryption failure probability--a key security advantage over many existing rank-based schemes."}

While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data. Furthermore, VIRO shows superior computational efficiency in terms of throughput, high reliability with a program failure rate of less than 0.3%, and scalability through decoupled program generation from execution."}

A recent trend is to develop RL systems with a fully disaggregated architecture, which decouples the three RL phases (rollout, reward, and training) onto separate resources and executes them asynchronously. However, two critical data-level concerns arise: (1) asynchronous execution leads to data staleness in trajectories (the data generated by rollout) as the model parameters used in rollout may not be up to date, which impairs RL convergence; and (2) the length variation of trajectories introduces severe data skewness, leading to workload imbalance and degraded system performance.\n  Existing systems fail to address these two concerns in a unified manner. Techniques that tightly control data staleness often constrain effective data skewness mitigation, while aggressive data skewness mitigation tends to exacerbate data staleness. As a result, systems are forced to trade off convergence for performance, or vice versa. To address this, we propose StaleFlow, an RL post-training system that jointly tackles data staleness and skewness. First, to control staleness, StaleFlow introduces a global consistency protocol that tracks the full lifecycle of each trajectory and constrains staleness. Second, to mitigate skewness, StaleFlow re-designs the RL system architecture by constructing data servers for trajectories and parameters to achieve flexible rollout coordination. Subsequently, we develop a suite of staleness-aware, throughput-oriented strategies to enhance system performance. Evaluations show that StaleFlow achieves up to 1.42-2.68$\\times$ (1.17-2.01$\\times$ on average) higher throughput than state-of-the-art systems, without compromising convergence."}

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

Building on this, we propose Dual-task Universal Adversarial Perturbation (DUAP). Specifically, DUAP employs a targeted surrogate objective to effectively disrupt ASR transcription and introduces a Dynamic Normalized Ensemble (DNE) strategy to enhance transferability across diverse SR models. Furthermore, we incorporate psychoacoustic masking to ensure perturbation imperceptibility. Extensive evaluations across five ASR and six SR models demonstrate that DUAP achieves high simultaneous attack success rates and superior imperceptibility, significantly outperforming existing single-task baselines."}

We propose the Selective Kernel and Asymmetric convolution Network(SKANet), a cognitive deep learning framework built upon a dual-stream architecture that integrates Time-Frequency Images (TFIs) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). Distinct from conventional fusion methods that rely on static receptive fields, the proposed architecture incorporates a Multi-Branch Selective Kernel (SK) module combined with Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACBs).

To facilitate the latter, we utilize averaged measurements derived from multiple repeated observations. We provide a detailed convergence analysis of the method in statistical prospective, establishing its stability and regularization properties under both stopping strategies. The algorithm begins with the computation of an initial reconstruction using any suitable techniques like Tikhonov regularization (Tik), filtered back projection (FBP) or total variation (TV), which is used as the foundation for generating the initial graph Laplacian.

We provide a description of these two strategies and develop fourth-order time accurate schemes in the context of our Maxwell's system. However, our description can be used to prescribe similar fourth- or even higher-order time-integration methods for any linear (or quasi-linear) system of time-dependent partial differential equations. Our organizing principle in our proposed two strategies is to Taylor expand the unknown solution in time by assuming sufficient regularity. Then, in the spatial strategy, we use Maxwell's equations themselves to replace the fourth-order time derivatives in an appropriately truncated Taylor expansion with corresponding higher-order spatial derivatives. On the other hand, in the temporal strategy, we simply use higher-order finite difference schemes for the various higher-order time derivative terms in the truncated Taylor approximation. In both cases, we then defer to a standard finite element exterior calculus manner of compatible discretization for the spatial component of the Maxwell's solution. For our proposed schemes corresponding to the two strategies, we show that they are both stable and convergent and provide some validating numerical examples in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Our main contributions are in the development of the fourth-order time discretization methods that are energy conserving using our two outlined strategies and proofs of their convergence for semi- and full-discretizations of our three-field system of Maxwell's equations."}

In this work, we present FRoM-W1, an open-source framework designed to achieve general humanoid whole-body motion control using natural language. To universally understand natural language and generate corresponding motions, as well as enable various humanoid robots to stably execute these motions in the physical world under gravity, FRoM-W1 operates in two stages: (a) H-GPT: utilizing massive human data, a large-scale language-driven human whole-body motion generation model is trained to generate diverse natural behaviors. We further leverage the Chain-of-Thought technique to improve the model's generalization in instruction understanding. (b) H-ACT: After retargeting generated human whole-body motions into robot-specific actions, a motion controller that is pretrained and further fine-tuned through reinforcement learning in physical simulation enables humanoid robots to accurately and stably perform corresponding actions. It is then deployed on real robots via a modular simulation-to-reality module. We extensively evaluate FRoM-W1 on Unitree H1 and G1 robots. Results demonstrate superior performance on the HumanML3D-X benchmark for human whole-body motion generation, and our introduced reinforcement learning fine-tuning consistently improves both motion tracking accuracy and task success rates of these humanoid robots. We open-source the entire FRoM-W1 framework and hope it will advance the development of humanoid intelligence."}

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when incorporated into state-of-the-art graph instruction tuning methods, SIT-Graph significantly enhances their performance on text-attributed graph benchmarks, achieving over 20% improvement under the low label ratio settings."}

JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods."}

We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination. Our results provide a mechanistic insight of when and how CLIP-style models acquire relational competence."}

Efforts based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have attempted to address these assumptions but continue to reinforce what we term the SPECIALISATION FALLACY-the belief that specialised medical LLMs are inherently superior for CQA. To address this assumption, we introduce MEDASSESS-X, a deployment-industry-oriented CQA framework that applies alignment at inference time rather than through SFT. MEDASSESS-X uses lightweight steering vectors to guide model activations toward medically consistent reasoning without updating model weights or requiring domain-specific retraining. This inference-time alignment layer stabilises CQA performance across both general-purpose and specialised medical LLMs, thereby resolving the SPECIALISATION FALLACY.

In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the width inference problem for FIRRTL programs. We show that, if the constraints obtained from a FIRRTL program are satisfiable, there exists a unique least solution. Based on this result, we propose a complete procedure for solving the width inference problem. We implement it in the interactive theorem prover Rocq and prove its functional correctness. From the Rocq implementation, we extract an OCaml implementation, which is the first formally verified implementation of the InferWidths pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can solve more instances than the official InferWidths pass in firtool, normally with high efficiency."}

Inspired by recent advances in rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression, this work integrates semantic learning into the compression pipeline to support decoder-side applications--such as scene editing and manipulation--that extend beyond traditional scene reconstruction and view synthesis. Our scheme features a lightweight implicit neural representation-based hyperprior, enabling efficient entropy coding of both color and semantic attributes while avoiding costly grid-based hyperprior as seen in many prior works. To facilitate compression and segmentation, we further develop compression-guided segmentation learning, consisting of quantization-aware training to enhance feature separability and a quality-aware weighting mechanism to suppress unreliable Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces transmission cost while preserving high rendering quality and strong segmentation performance."}

SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning.

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR.

Recent advancements in 3D vision, particularly learned radiance-field representations such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have begun to raise the ceiling on reconstruction fidelity and densifiable geometry from posed imagery. Nevertheless, direct aerial measurement of important natural attributes such as tree diameter at breast height (DBH) remains challenging. Trunks in aerial forest scans are distant and sparsely observed in image views: at typical operating altitudes, stems may span only a few pixels. With these constraints, conventional reconstruction methods leave breast-height trunk geometry weakly constrained. We present TreeDGS, an aerial image reconstruction method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous, densifiable scene representation for trunk measurement. After SfM-MVS initialization and Gaussian optimization, we extract a dense point set from the Gaussian field using RaDe-GS's depth-aware cumulative-opacity integration and associate each sample with a multi-view opacity reliability score. We then estimate DBH from trunk-isolated points using opacity-weighted solid-circle fitting. Evaluated on 10 plots with field-measured DBH, TreeDGS reaches 4.79,cm RMSE (about 2.6 pixels at this GSD) and outperforms a state-of-the-art LiDAR baseline (7.91,cm RMSE), demonstrating that densified splat-based geometry can enable accurate, low-cost aerial DBH measurement."}

Using the publicly available IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, we evaluate five representative architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-161, EfficientNet-B0, and ViT-Base-Patch16-224, to explore model-dependent variations in Grad-CAM interpretability.

Experimental findings reveal that while Grad-CAM effectively highlights salient tumor regions in most convolutional networks, its interpretive fidelity significantly degrades for Vision Transformer models due to non-local attention behavior. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons indicate substantial variability in saliency localization, implying that Grad-CAM explanations may not always correspond to the true diagnostic evidence used by the networks. This work exposes critical limitations of current saliency-based XAI approaches in medical imaging and emphasizes the need for model-aware interpretability methods that are both computationally sound and clinically meaningful.

Both arise from input data, propagate through recommendation models, and lead to unfair or suboptimal outcomes. Popularity bias occurs when a small subset of items receives most interactions, while positivity bias stems from the over-representation of high rating values. Although each bias has been studied independently, their combined effect, to which we refer to as multifactorial bias, remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how multifactorial bias influences item-side fairness, focusing on exposure bias, which reflects the unequal visibility of items in recommendation outputs. Through simulation studies, we find that positivity bias is disproportionately concentrated on popular items, further amplifying their over-exposure. Motivated by this insight, we adapt a percentile-based rating transformation as a pre-processing strategy to mitigate multifactorial bias. Experiments using six recommendation algorithms across four public datasets show that this approach improves exposure fairness with negligible accuracy loss. We also demonstrate that integrating this pre-processing step into post-processing fairness pipelines enhances their effectiveness and efficiency, enabling comparable or better fairness with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multifactorial bias and demonstrate the practical value of simple, data-driven pre-processing methods for improving fairness in recommender systems."}

This occurs because current pipelines sample candidate steps from generic prompts or learned policies with weak domain priors, yielding near-random walks over operators, units, and formats. To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability."}

The project addresses a central methodological challenge in educational and interactional research: the analysis of verbal, paraverbal, and non-verbal data is currently carried out manually, making it extremely time-consuming and difficult to scale. TRAIMA explores how machine learning approaches could contribute to the categorisation and classification of such interactions. The project focuses specifically on explanatory and collaborative sequences occurring in classroom interactions, particularly in French as a Foreign Language (FLE) and French as a First Language (FLM) contexts. These sequences are analysed as inherently multimodal phenomena, combining spoken language with prosody, gestures, posture, gaze, and spatial positioning. A key theoretical contribution of the project is the precise linguistic and interactional definition of explanatory discourse as a tripartite sequence (opening, explanatory core, closure), drawing on discourse analysis and interactional linguistics. A substantial part of the research is devoted to the methodological foundations of transcription, which constitute a critical bottleneck for any form of automation. The report provides a detailed state of the art of existing transcription conventions (ICOR, Mondada, GARS, VALIBEL, Ferr{é}), highlighting their respective strengths and limitations when applied to multimodal classroom data. Through comparative analyses of manually transcribed sequences, the project demonstrates the inevitable variability and interpretative dimension of transcription practices, depending on theoretical positioning and analytical goals. Empirical work is based on several corpora, notably the INTER-EXPLIC corpus (approximately 30 hours of classroom interaction) and the EXPLIC-LEXIC corpus, which serve both as testing grounds for manual annotation and as reference datasets for future automation. Particular attention is paid to teacher gestures (kin{é}sic and proxemic resources), prosodic features, and their functional role in meaning construction and learner comprehension. The project also highlights the strategic role of the Techn{é}LAB platform, which provides advanced multimodal data capture (multi-camera video, synchronized audio, eye-tracking, digital interaction traces) and constitutes both a research infrastructure and a test environment for the development of automated tools. In conclusion, TRAIMA does not aim to deliver a fully operational automated system, but rather to establish a rigorous methodological framework for the automatic processing of multimodal pedagogical interactions. The project identifies transcription conventions, annotation categories, and analytical units that are compatible with machine learning approaches, while emphasizing the need for theoretical explicitness and researcher reflexivity. TRAIMA thus lays the groundwork for future interdisciplinary research at the intersection of didactics, discourse analysis, multimodality, and artificial intelligence in education."}

However, annotating conventional programs with the formal specification and verification constructs (preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, auxiliary predicates and functions and proof helpers) required to prove their correctness still demands significant manual effort and expertise. This paper investigates how LLMs can automatically generate such annotations for programs written in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, starting from conventional code accompanied by natural language specifications (in comments) and test code. In experiments on 110 Dafny programs, a multimodel approach combining Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 generated correct annotations for 98.2% of the programs within at most 8 repair iterations, using verifier feedback. A logistic regression analysis shows that proof-helper annotations contribute disproportionately to problem difficulty for current LLMs. Assertions in the test cases served as static oracles to automatically validate the generated pre/postconditions. We also compare generated and manual solutions and present an extension for Visual Studio Code to incorporate automatic generation into the IDE, with encouraging usability feedback."}

In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \\rightarrow -\\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \\in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \\leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p > 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \\leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $Σ_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items."}

To make accessible earlier, authors would like to put it on arxiv before the conference", "summary": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

However, in challenging scenarios such as large pose variations, illumination changes, and facial expression variations, they still struggle to accurately capture the geometric structure of the face, resulting in performance degradation. Moreover, the limited size and diversity of existing FLD datasets hinder robust model training, leading to reduced detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a Frequency-Guided Task-Balancing Transformer (FGTBT), which enhances facial structure perception through frequency-domain modeling and multi-dataset unified training. Specifically, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Multi-Task Balancing loss (FMB-loss), which moves beyond coarse task-level balancing by assigning weights to individual landmarks based on their occurrence across datasets. This enables more effective unified training and mitigates the issue of inconsistent gradient magnitudes. Additionally, a Frequency-Guided Structure-Aware (FGSA) model is designed to utilize frequency-guided structure injection and regularization to help learn facial structure constraints. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the integration of the proposed FMB-loss and FGSA model into our FGTBT framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

However, this paradigm encounters critical challenges when applied to vision-language models (VLM) (e.g., CLIP): constructing adversarially robust teacher for large-scale multi-modal models demands prohibitively high computational resources. We bridge this gap by revealing an interesting phenomenon: vanilla CLIP (without adversarial training) exhibits intrinsic defensive capabilities against adversarial examples generated by another CLIP with different architectures. We formally define this as proxy adversarial robustness, and naturally propose a Heterogeneous Proxy Transfer (HPT) framework that establishes cross-architectural robustness distillation channels between CLIP variants, effortlessly enabling the VLM robustness transfer from proxy to target models. Yet, such proxy transfer paradigm easily induces severe overfitting, leading to a sharp degradation in zero-shot natural generalization. To resolve that, we design Generalization-Pivot Decoupling (GPD) by leveraging the difference in learning rate scheduling. This decouples the proxy transfer process into a generalization-anchored warm-up that maintains generalization and a generalization-pulled HPT that promotes adversarial robustness, to achieve an equilibrium between natural generalization and adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HPT-GPD method. The code is available at the website of github.com/fxw13/HPT-GPD."}

Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis.

We find that demographic information is distributed across internal units with substantial cross-model variation. Although some units encode sensitive or stereotype-related associations from pretraining, identical demographic cues can induce qualitatively different behaviors. Interventions suppressing such neurons reduce bias but leave substantial residual effects, suggesting behavioral rather than representational change and motivating more systematic mitigation."}

This strategy enables the models to incorporate information from neighboring frames, significantly improving image quality during testing. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that this framework effectively preserves mouth shapes during expression manipulations, highlighting the substantial benefits of integrating AD-THG with SPFEM."}

The ability to accurately and rapidly respond to directional visual cues is critical in these contexts. How whole-body motion and individual differences affect human perception and reaction to these directional cues is therefore a key, yet an underexplored question for HCI. This study used a 6-DOF motion platform to measure task performance on a visual direction judgment task. We analyzed performance by decomposing the complex motion into two distinct components: a task-irrelevant lateral interference component and a task-aligned directional congruency component. Results indicate that increased motion intensity lengthened reaction times. This effect was primarily driven by the lateral interference component, and this detrimental impact was disproportionately amplified for individuals with high motion sickness susceptibility. Conversely, directional congruency, where motion direction matched the visual cue, improved performance for all participants. These findings suggest that motion's impact on cognition is not monolithic, and that system design for mobile HCI can be informed by strategies that actively shape motion, such as minimizing lateral interference while maximizing directional congruency."}

Recently, a multitude of communication methods have been introduced to this field to address problems such as partially observable environments, non-stationarity, and exponentially growing action spaces. Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches."}

The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and through backtracking of its predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing methods on multiple public and self-built datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios."}

Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs. Our framework is easily extendable to other inventory models, offering an efficient and fast alternative for analyzing complex stochastic systems."}

However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions.

In this work, we reframe test-time adaptation as a budget-constrained memory consolidation problem, focusing on which parts of the context should be consolidated into working memory under limited computation. We propose Gdwm (Gated Differentiable Working Memory), a framework that introduces a write controller to gate the consolidation process.

To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised framework called Supervision-by-Hallucination-and-Transfer (SHT) for more robust and precise FLD. SHT contains two novel mutually enhanced modules: Dual Hallucination Learning Network (DHLN) and Facial Pose Transfer Network (FPTN). By incorporating FLD and face hallucination tasks, DHLN is able to learn high-resolution representations with low-resolution inputs for recovering both facial structures and local details and generating more effective landmark heatmaps.

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,δ_i,\\overlineΔ)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $Δ$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design.

However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks."}

However, they are still prone to generating irrelevant descriptions due to the lack of contextual information and the over-reliance on generated partial descriptions for predicting the remaining words. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Stream Collaborative Transformer (DSCT) to address this issue by introducing the segmentation feature. The proposed DSCT consolidates and then fuses the region and segmentation features to guide the generation of caption sentences. It contains multiple Pattern-Specific Mutual Attention Encoders (PSMAEs) and Dynamic Nomination Decoders (DNDs). The PSMAE effectively highlights and consolidates the private information of two representations by querying each other. The DND dynamically searches for the most relevant learning blocks to the input textual representations and exploits the homogeneous features between the consolidated region and segmentation features to generate more accurate and descriptive caption sentences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how to fuse different pattern-specific features in a dynamic way to bypass their semantic inconsistencies and spatial misalignment issues for image captioning. The experimental results from popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art image captioning models in the literature."}

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs."}

Most methods assume a fixed slot count K, and to better accommodate the dynamic nature of object cardinality, a few works have explored K-adaptive variants. However, existing K-adaptive methods still suffer from two limitations. First, they do not explicitly constrain slot-binding quality, so low-quality slots lead to ambiguous feature attribution. Second, adding a slot-count penalty to the reconstruction objective creates conflicting optimization goals between reducing the number of active slots and maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a result, they still lag significantly behind strong K-fixed baselines. To address these challenges, we propose Quality-Guided K-Adaptive Slot Attention (QASA). First, we decouple slot selection from reconstruction, eliminating the mutual constraints between the two objectives. Then, we propose an unsupervised Slot-Quality metric to assess per-slot quality, providing a principled signal for fine-grained slot--object binding. Based on this metric, we design a Quality-Guided Slot Selection scheme that dynamically selects a subset of high-quality slots and feeds them into our newly designed gated decoder for reconstruction during training. At inference, token-wise competition on slot attention yields a K-adaptive outcome. Experiments show that QASA substantially outperforms existing K-adaptive methods on both real and synthetic datasets. Moreover, on real-world datasets QASA surpasses K-fixed methods."}

We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations. While some leakage remains in certain fine-tuning regimes, these results suggest that MIAs are brittle in adversarial settings and insufficient, on their own, as a standalone mechanism for copyright auditing of LLMs."}

The central challenge is therefore not whether machines become conscious, but whether processes of interpretation and shared reference are progressively automated in ways that marginalize human participation. This paper introduces the PRMO framework, relating AI design trajectories to four constitutive dimensions of human subjectivity: Perception, Representation, Meaning, and the Real. Within this framework, Synthetic Sociality denotes a technological horizon in which artificial agents negotiate coherence and social order primarily among themselves, raising the structural risk of human exclusion from meaning formation. To address this risk, the paper proposes Quadrangulation as a design principle for socially embedded AI systems, requiring artificial agents to treat the human subject as a constitutive reference within shared contexts of meaning. This work is a conceptual perspective that contributes a structural vocabulary for analyzing AI systems at the intersection of computation and society, without proposing a specific technical implementation."}

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

With GazeD we also introduce a novel way of representing the 3D gaze by positioning it as an additional body joint at a fixed distance from the eyes.

We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure.

While the effectiveness of these models can be theoretically explained using differential equations related to the sampling process, previous work by Song and Ermon (2020) demonstrated that neural networks using multiplicative noise conditioning can still generate satisfactory samples. In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude. This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates."}

Such tool-based agents are rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for deploying language models in production. Unlike traditional single-turn inference, agentic workloads chain together multiple LLM calls and tool executions before producing a final response, creating a new performance bottleneck that manifests as increased latency in First Token Rendered (FTR) of the final answer. Through analysis of synthetic requests at production scale, we reveal three critical challenges: tool calls account for 30-80% of FTR latency, KV cache hit rates collapse despite substantial context reuse across iterations, and sequential orchestration wastes potential intra-request parallelism by sequentially executing LLM calls and tools. These bottlenecks stem from a design gap in which orchestrators and LLM engines operate as decoupled black boxes, preventing cross-layer optimizations. We present SUTRADHARA, a co-designed agentic inference system that integrates orchestration with LLM serving through a thin API enabling three optimizations: overlap tool execution with subsequent LLM prefill using tool-aware prompt splitting, streaming tool execution to dispatch tools incrementally during decode rather than waiting for complete output, and orchestrator-aware cache management that uses semantic hints to improve hit rates and reduce thrashing. Implemented on vLLM, SUTRADHARA reduces median FTR latency by 15% and end-to-end latency by 10% across workloads on A100 GPUs, demonstrating that co-design can systematically tame latency in agentic systems."}

In practice, however, their performance is often hindered by limited representational capacity and optimization difficulties caused by competing physical constraints and conflicting gradients. In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs.

Evaluating Conversational Repair in Large Audio-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in spoken question answering (QA), with existing evaluations primarily focusing on answer accuracy and robustness to acoustic perturbations. However, such evaluations implicitly assume that spoken inputs remain semantically answerable, an assumption that often fails in real-world interaction when essential information is missing. In this work, we introduce a repair-aware evaluation setting that explicitly distinguishes between answerable and unanswerable audio inputs. We define answerability as a property of the input itself and construct paired evaluation conditions using a semantic-acoustic masking protocol. Based on this setting, we propose the Evaluability Awareness and Repair (EAR) score, a non-compensatory metric that jointly evaluates task competence under answerable conditions and repair behavior under unanswerable conditions. Experiments on two spoken QA benchmarks across diverse LALMs reveal a consistent gap between answer accuracy and conversational reliability: while many models perform well when inputs are answerable, most fail to recognize semantic unanswerability and initiate appropriate conversational repair. These findings expose a limitation of prevailing accuracy-centric evaluation practices and motivate reliability assessments that treat unanswerable inputs as cues for repair and continued interaction."}

To explore this boundary in dentistry, a domain where high-quality AI advice uniquely empowers patient-participatory decision-making, we present the Standardized Clinical Management & Performance Evaluation (SCMPE) benchmark, which comprehensively assesses performance from knowledge-oriented evaluations (static objective tasks) to workflow-based simulations (multi-turn simulated patient interactions). Our analysis reveals that while models demonstrate high proficiency in static objective tasks, their performance precipitates in dynamic clinical dialogues, identifying that the primary bottleneck lies not in knowledge retention, but in the critical challenges of active information gathering and dynamic state tracking. Mapping \"Guideline Adherence\" versus \"Decision Quality\" reveals a prevalent \"High Efficacy, Low Safety\" risk in general models. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG mitigates hallucinations in static tasks, its efficacy in dynamic workflows is limited and heterogeneous, sometimes causing degradation. This underscores that external knowledge alone cannot bridge the reasoning gap without domain-adaptive pre-training. This study empirically charts the capability boundaries of dental LLMs, providing a roadmap for bridging the gap between standardized knowledge and safe, autonomous clinical practice."}

It has been used for various tasks such as retrieving similar items in high-dimensional images or text data. In retrieval applications, however, the Wasserstein distance is calculated repeatedly, and its cubic time complexity with respect to input size renders it unsuitable for large-scale datasets. Recently, tree-based approximation methods have been proposed to address this bottleneck. For example, the Flowtree algorithm computes transport on a quadtree and evaluates cost using the ground metric, and clustering-tree approaches have been reported to achieve high accuracy. However, these existing trees often incur significant construction time for preprocessing, and crucially, standard quadtrees cannot grow deep enough in high-dimensional spaces, resulting in poor approximation accuracy. In this paper, we propose kd-Flowtree, a kd-tree-based Wasserstein distance approximation method that uses a kd-tree for data embedding. Since kd-trees can grow sufficiently deep and adaptively even in high-dimensional cases, kd-Flowtree is capable of maintaining good approximation accuracy for such cases. In addition, kd-trees can be constructed quickly than quadtrees, which contributes to reducing the computation time required for nearest neighbor search, including preprocessing. We provide a probabilistic upper bound on the nearest-neighbor search accuracy of kd-Flowtree, and show that this bound is independent of the dataset size. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrated that kd-Flowtree outperformed the existing Wasserstein distance approximation methods for retrieval tasks with real-world data."}

A key use case is detecting event-based signatures, which represent attacks spanning multiple events and can only be understood once the relevant events are identified and linked. Analysing event datasets is essential for monitoring system security, but their growing volume and frequency create significant scalability and processing difficulties. Researchers rely on these datasets to develop and test techniques for automatically identifying signatures. However, because real datasets are security-sensitive and rarely shared, it becomes difficult to perform meaningful comparative evaluation between different approaches. This work addresses this evaluation limitation by offering a systematic method for generating event logs with known ground truth, enabling reproducible and comparable research. We present a novel parametrised generation technique capable of producing synthetic event datasets that contain event-based signatures for discovery. To demonstrate the capabilities of the technique, we provide a benchmark in signature detection. Our benchmarking demonstrated the suitability of DBSCAN, achieving a score greater than 0.95 Adjusted Rand Index on most generated datasets.

However, does such efficiency gains translate into effective agentic behavior? In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) across two distinct agentic paradigms: Embodied Agents (requiring long-horizon planning) and Tool-Calling Agents (requiring precise formatting). Contrary to the efficiency hype, our results on Agentboard and BFCL reveal a \"bitter lesson\": current dLLMs fail to serve as reliable agentic backbones, frequently leading to systematically failure. (1) In Embodied settings, dLLMs suffer repeated attempts, failing to branch under temporal feedback. (2) In Tool-Calling settings, dLLMs fail to maintain symbolic precision (e.g. strict JSON schemas) under diffusion noise. To assess the potential of dLLMs in agentic workflows, we introduce DiffuAgent, a multi-agent evaluation framework that integrates dLLMs as plug-and-play cognitive cores. Our analysis shows that dLLMs are effective in non-causal roles (e.g., memory summarization and tool selection) but require the incorporation of causal, precise, and logically grounded reasoning mechanisms into the denoising process to be viable for agentic tasks."}

While the ubiquity and low cost of commodity Wi-Fi make it an ideal platform for wide-scale sensing, it is the continuous evolution of Wi-Fi standards-towards higher frequency bands, wider bandwidths, and larger antenna arrays-that fundamentally unlocks the physical resources required for high-performance ISAC. To structure this rapidly expanding field, numerous surveys have appeared. However, prevailing literature predominantly adopts a top-down perspective, emphasizing upper-layer applications or deep learning models while treating the physical layer as an opaque abstraction. Consequently, these works often fail to touch the bottom layer of signal formation and lack technical guidance on overcoming the physical barriers that constrain sensing performance. To bridge this gap, this tutorial takes a bottom-up approach, systematically analyzing the sensing gains brought by Wi-Fi advancements through the lens of physical-layer diversity. We organize the framework around four orthogonal dimensions: i) Temporal Diversity addresses synchronization gaps to enable absolute ranging; ii) Frequency Diversity expands the effective bandwidth to sharpen range resolution; iii) Link Diversity leverages distributed topologies and digital feedback to achieve ubiquitous observability; and iv) Spatial Diversity utilizes multi-antenna arrays to combine passive angular discrimination with active directional control. Collectively, these orthogonal dimensions resolve fundamental ambiguities in time, range, and space, bridging physical capabilities with challenging sensing diversities. By synthesizing these dimensions, this tutorial provides a comprehensive guide for \"ISAC-izing\" commodity Wi-Fi, paving the way for future standardization and robust deployment."}

At the same time, current LLMs still struggle to fully interpret complex and multifaceted tasks. To address this gap, we argue for a stronger task-based perspective on query intent.

Conventional backdoor fingerprinting, however, is flawed by a stealth-robustness paradox: to be robust, these methods force models to memorize fixed responses to high-perplexity triggers, but this targeted overfitting creates detectable statistical artifacts. We resolve this paradox with KinGuard, a framework that embeds a private knowledge corpus built on structured kinship narratives. Instead of memorizing superficial triggers, the model internalizes this knowledge via incremental pre-training, and ownership is verified by probing its conceptual understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate KinGuard's superior effectiveness, stealth, and resilience against a battery of attacks including fine-tuning, input perturbation, and model merging. Our work establishes knowledge-based embedding as a practical and secure paradigm for model fingerprinting."}

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process.

However, with the emergence of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), concerns about economic centralization and content manipulation have intensified. To address these vulnerabilities, the Ethereum community has introduced Proposer Builder Separation (PBS), which separates block construction from block proposal. Later, enshrined Proposer Builder Separation (ePBS) was also proposed in EIP-7732, which embeds PBS directly into the Ethereum consensus layer.\n  Our work identifies key limitations of ePBS by developing a formal framework that combines mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations to evaluate its auction-based block-building mechanism, with particular emphasis on MEV dynamics. Our results reveal that, although ePBS redistributes responsibilities between builders and proposers, it significantly amplifies profit and content centralization: the Gini coefficient for profits rises from 0.1749 under standard PoS without ePBS to 0.8358 under ePBS. This sharp increase indicates that a small number of efficient builders capture most value via MEV-driven auctions. Moreover, 95.4% of the block value is rewarded to proposers in ePBS, revealing a strong economic bias despite their limited role in block assembly. These findings highlight that ePBS exacerbates incentives for builders to adopt aggressive MEV strategies, suggesting the need for future research into mechanism designs that better balance decentralization, fairness, and MEV mitigation."}

To support this, we present UniHand-2.0, the largest embodied pre-training recipe to date, comprising over 35,000 hours of multimodal data across 30 distinct robotic embodiments. Our approach introduces a Unified Action Space that maps heterogeneous robot controls into semantically aligned slots, enabling low-resource robots to bootstrap skills from human data and high-resource platforms.

However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based). Extensive experiments demonstrate AsyncBEV improves robustness against both small and large asynchrony between LiDAR or camera sensors in both the token-based CMT and grid-based UniBEV, especially for dynamic objects.

Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

At the same time, this growth has led to an increase in hate speech, the main global threat. To improve the reliability of black-box models used for hate speech detection, post-hoc approaches such as LIME, SHAP, and LRP provide the explanation after training the classification model. In contrast, multi-task approaches based on the HateXplain benchmark learn to explain and classify simultaneously. However, results from HateXplain-based algorithms show that predicted attention varies considerably when it should be constant. This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer. Thus, if the explanation is correctly estimated, thanks to multi-task learning (explainability and classification task), the model could classify better and commit fewer unintentional bias errors related to communities. The experimental results on HateXplain data show a clear improvement in detection performance, explainability and a reduction in unintentional bias."}

We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks.

By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench.

This work is motivated by applications in model order reduction (MOR) of switched linear systems (SLS) in control form, where GLEs play a central role. We analyze how inaccuracies in the numerical solution of GLEs propagate through the MOR procedure and affect the accuracy and reliability of the reduced order model. Furthermore, the classical balanced-truncation error estimate for SLS is neither theoretically nor practically viable, as they rely on restrictive assumptions requiring several requiring several linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to be satisfied exactly by numerically computed solutions of the GLEs. To overcome these limitation, we propose a new MOR framework for SLS, called piecewise balanced reduction (PBR). The method is based on solving multiple GLEs and the construction of projection matrices that are piecewise constant in time to appropriately balance and subsequently reduce the SLS. We extend the standard balanced-truncation error bounds and demonstrate that the PBR formulation allows us to control the error arising from the inexact LMI. In addition, our new error bound accounts for the influence of the piecewise constant time-varying projection matrices. Altogether, this renders the PBR approach for SLS applicable to a broad and flexible class of SLS. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our theoretical results."}

One approach is to completely abandon the concept of CPU -- and thus serial imperative programming -- and instead to specify and execute tasks in parallel, compiling from programming languages to data flow digital logic. It is well-known that pure functional languages are inherently parallel, due to the Church-Rosser theorem, and CPU-based parallel compilers exist for many functional languages. However, these still rely on conventional CPUs and their von Neumann bottlenecks. An alternative is to compile functional languages directly into digital logic to maximize available parallelism. It is difficult to work with complete modern functional languages due to their many features, so we demonstrate a proof-of-concept system using lambda calculus as the source language and compiling to digital logic. We show how functional hardware can be tailored to a simplistic functional language, forming the ground for a new model of CPU-less functional computation. At the algorithmic level, we use a tree-based representation, with data localized within nodes and communicated data passed between them. This is implemented by physical digital logic blocks corresponding to nodes, and buses enabling message passing. Node types and behaviors correspond to lambda grammar forms, and beta-reductions are performed in parallel allowing branches independent from one another to perform transformations simultaneously. As evidence for this approach, we present an implementation, along with simulation results, showcasing successful execution of lambda expressions. This suggests that the approach could be scaled to larger functional languages.

Recently, Saxena et al.~[TCS 2025] investigated the exploration problem under both models. In this work, we first strengthen the existing impossibility results for the $1$-Interval Connectivity model. We then show that, in Connectivity Time dynamic graphs, exploration is impossible with $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ mobile agents, even when the agents have full knowledge of all system parameters, global communication, full visibility, and infinite memory. This significantly improves the previously known bound of $n$. Moreover, we prove that to solve exploration with $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}+1$ agents, $1$-hop visibility is necessary.

This paper introduces the Simplification Profiler, a diagnostic toolkit that generates a multidimensional, interpretable fingerprint of simplified texts. Multiple aggregated simplifications of a model result in a model's fingerprint. This novel evaluation paradigm is particularly vital for languages, where the data scarcity problem is magnified when creating flexible models for diverse target groups rather than a single, fixed simplification style. We propose that measuring a model's unique behavioral signature is more relevant in this context as an alternative to correlating metrics with human preferences. We operationalize this with a practical meta-evaluation of our fingerprints' descriptive power, which bypasses the need for large, human-rated datasets. This test measures if a simple linear classifier can reliably identify various model configurations by their created simplifications, confirming that our metrics are sensitive to a model's specific characteristics. The Profiler can distinguish high-level behavioral variations between prompting strategies and fine-grained changes from prompt engineering, including few-shot examples. Our complete feature set achieves classification F1-scores up to 71.9 %, improving upon simple baselines by over 48 percentage points. The Simplification Profiler thus offers developers a granular, actionable analysis to build more effective and truly adaptive text simplification systems."}

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE < 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings.

However, two central challenges remain unresolved: automating the evaluation of agent trajectories and generating high-quality training data at scale to enable continual improvement. Existing approaches often depend on manual annotation or static rule-based verification, which restricts scalability and limits adaptability in dynamic environments. We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness. These results establish MagicGUI-RMS as a principled and effective foundation for building self-improving GUI agents driven by reward-based adaptation."}

Such BS consists of multiple antenna arrays that are mechanically movable along a circular rail to adapt to the horizontal user hotspots, and each array is equipped with pattern reconfigurable antennas (PRAs) that are capable of electronically switching among a set of specified beam patterns to cater to the instantaneous user channels. The mechanical adjustment provides wide-angle coverage but suffers from slow response, while the electronic tuning enables rapid beam reconfiguration but with limited angular range. To effectively combine their complementary advantages, we propose to jointly design both mechanical and electronic configurations to maximize the average sum-rate of users via a two-timescale optimization approach, in which the array positions are optimized on the long timescale according to large-scale user distribution statistics, and the pattern selection vectors are optimized on the short timescale to enable fast beam alignment based on the instantaneous user locations. An alternating optimization algorithm based on the Monte Carlo sampling method is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed design achieves significant performance gains over various benchmark schemes."}

Call these things characters. Are characters minded and psychologically continuous entities with mental states like beliefs, desires and intentions? Illusionists about characters say No. On this view, characters are merely anthropomorphic projections in the mind of the user and so lack mental states. Jonathan Birch (2025) defends this view. He says that the distributed nature of LLM processing, in which several LLMs may be implicated in the simulation of a character in a single conversation, precludes the existence of a persistent minded entity that is identifiable with the character. Against illusionism, we argue for a realist position on which characters exist as minded and psychologically continuous entities. Our central point is that Birch's argument for illusionism rests on a category error: characters are not internal to the LLMs that simulate them, but rather are co-simulated by LLMs and users, emerging in a shared conversational workspace through a process of mutual theory of mind modelling. We argue that characters, and their minds, exist as 'real patterns' on grounds that attributing mental states to characters is essential for making efficient and accurate predictions about the conversational dynamics (c.f. Dennett, 1991). Furthermore, because the character exists within the conversational workspace rather than within the LLM, psychological continuity is preserved even when the underlying computational substrate is distributed across multiple LLM instances."}

Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft \"adversarial news\" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include \"malicious\" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points. To assess real-world feasibility, we analyze popular scraping libraries and trading platforms and survey 27 FinTech practitioners, confirming our hypotheses.

During off-peak hours, large parts of the networks remain underutilized, presenting significant potential for energy savings. Existing Green Traffic Engineering approaches attempt to leverage this potential by switching off those parts of the networks that are not required for the routing of specific traffic matrices. When traffic changes, the approaches need to adapt rapidly, which is hard to achieve given the complexity of the problem. We take a fundamentally different approach: instead of considering a specific traffic matrix, we rely on a traffic-oblivious routing scheme. We discuss the NP-hard problem of activating as few connections as possible while still guaranteeing that any down-scaled traffic matrix $\\varrho\\cdot T$ can be routed, where $\\varrho \\in (0,1)$ and $T$ is any traffic matrix routable in the original network. We present a $\\max(\\frac{1}{\\varrho\\cdotλ_{\\text{min}}},2)$-approximation algorithm for this problem, with $λ_{\\text{min}}$ denoting the minimum number of connections between any two connected routers.

Existing algorithmic fairness approaches typically seek to reduce such disparities by suppressing sensitive attributes. However, in medical settings these attributes often carry essential diagnostic information, and removing them can degrade accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications. In contrast, clinical decision making explicitly incorporates patient context when interpreting diagnostic evidence, suggesting a different design direction for subgroup-aware models. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a patient-conditioned adaptation framework that improves subgroup reliability while maintaining a shared diagnostic model. Clinically relevant attributes such as age and sex are encoded into a compact embedding and used to condition a hypernetwork-style module, which generates small residual modulation parameters for selected layers of a shared backbone. This design preserves the general medical knowledge learned by the backbone while enabling targeted adjustments that reflect patient-specific variability. To ensure efficiency and robustness, adaptations are constrained through low-rank and bottlenecked parameterizations, limiting both model complexity and computational overhead. Experiments across multiple public medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves subgroup-level performance without sacrificing overall accuracy. On the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, our method outperforms the strongest competing baseline by 4.1% in recall and 4.4% in F1 score, with larger gains observed for underrepresented patient populations."}

The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination.

However, the mathematical behavior of recursive or multi-generation distillation remains poorly understood, with prior approaches relying primarily on empirical heuristics. In this work, we introduce an axiomatic and operator-theoretic framework for recursive meta-distillation, formalizing iterative knowledge distillation as a sequence of probability-distribution operators with explicit anchoring to base teachers.\n  We define structural axioms for valid meta-teacher construction and prove the existence of non-trivial operator families satisfying these axioms without specifying particular algorithms or loss functions. Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints."}

By using a single datum or a small subset of the data, selected randomly at each iteration, SGD scales well to problem size and has been shown to be effective for solving large-scale inverse problems. In this work, we investigate SGD for solving nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces through the lens of iterative regularization. Under general assumptions, we prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to the minimum distance solution and show the regularizing property in expectation under an a priori stopping rule. Further, we establish convergence rates under the conditional stability assumptions for both exact and noisy data.

However, recent studies have shown that reasoning models suffer from overthinking attacks, where models are tricked to generate unnecessarily high number of reasoning tokens. In this paper, we reveal that such overthinking risk can be inherited by RAG systems equipped with reasoning models, by proposing an end-to-end attack framework named Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension (CODE). Specifically, CODE develops a multi-agent architecture to construct poisoning samples that are injected into the knowledge base. These samples 1) are highly correlated with the use query, such that can be retrieved as inputs to the reasoning model; and 2) contain contradiction between the logical and evidence layers that cause models to overthink, and are optimized to exhibit highly diverse styles. Moreover, the inference overhead of CODE is extremely difficult to detect, as no modification is needed on the user query, and the task accuracy remain unaffected. Extensive experiments on two datasets across five commercial reasoning models demonstrate that the proposed attack causes a 5.32x-24.72x increase in reasoning token consumption, without degrading task performance. Finally, we also discuss and evaluate potential countermeasures to mitigate overthinking risks."}

Existing studies usually follow static rewrite, retrieve, and generate pipelines, which optimize different procedures separately and overlook the mixed-initiative action optimization simultaneously. Although the recent developments in deep search agents demonstrate the effectiveness in jointly optimizing retrieval and generation via reasoning, these approaches focus on single-turn scenarios, which might lack the ability to handle multi-turn interactions.

Cardinality estimation, a cornerstone of the optimizer, is critical for the selection of efficient query plans, as well as downstream tasks such as resource allocation and query scheduling. Yet, as many practitioners and researchers have noted, it is also the optimizer's Achilles heel. Prior studies on a number of industrial-strength databases show substantial cardinality estimation errors on all tested systems, with a far greater tendency to underestimate than to overestimate. Unfortunately, cardinality underestimation is more problematic than overestimation, as it misleads the optimizer to choose plans designed for small data, leading to underprovisioned CPU and memory.\n  While previous work on pessimistic cardinality estimation has proposed provable join size upper bounds, such methods can only correct overestimation, leaving the more harmful problem of underestimation unaddressed. To fill this critical gap, we introduce xBound, the very first framework for deriving provable join size lower bounds. xBound successfully reduces underestimation in real systems: On the JOBlight benchmark, it corrects 17.5% of subexpression underestimates in DuckDB and 8.7% in PostgreSQL, while on a Microsoft enterprise workload, it fixes 36.1% of Fabric Data Warehouse's underestimates, demonstrating a significant step towards solving this long-standing problem."}

First, we use an iterative, test-driven approach to automatically refine code generation prompts, and we analyze the outcome of this process to identify prompt improvement items that lead to test passes. We use such elements to elicit 10 guidelines for prompt improvement, related to better specifying I/O, pre-post conditions, providing examples, various types of details, or clarifying ambiguities. We conduct an assessment with 50 practitioners, who report their usage of the elicited prompt improvement patterns, as well as their perceived usefulness, which does not always correspond to the actual usage before knowing our guidelines. Our results lead to implications not only for practitioners and educators, but also for those aimed at creating better LLM-aided software development tools."}

However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata."}

Alternative studies based on object-centric RGB-D structured memories provide spatial grounding but are constrained by pre-fixed viewpoints. To address these issues, GaussExplorer introduces Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on top of 3DGS to enable question-driven exploration and reasoning within 3D scenes.

With the emergence of large-scale unlabeled human image datasets, there is an increasing need for a general unsupervised pre-training model capable of supporting diverse human-centric downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose CLASP (CLIP-guided Adaptable Self-suPervised learning), a novel framework designed for unsupervised pre-training in human-centric visual tasks. CLASP leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to generate both low-level (e.g., body parts) and high-level (e.g., attributes) semantic pseudo-labels. These multi-level semantic cues are then integrated into the learned visual representations, enriching their expressiveness and generalizability. Recognizing that different downstream tasks demand varying levels of semantic granularity, CLASP incorporates a Prompt-Controlled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. MoE dynamically adapts feature extraction based on task-specific prompts, mitigating potential feature conflicts and enhancing transferability. Furthermore, CLASP employs a multi-task pre-training strategy, where part- and attribute-level pseudo-labels derived from CLIP guide the representation learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CLASP consistently outperforms existing unsupervised pre-training methods, advancing the field of human-centric visual analysis."}

We formalize this landscape through a three-layer taxonomy: Data, Tools, and Value. We survey existing products to identify interoperability barriers. To bridge this gap, we extend TorchGeo with a unified API that standardizes the loading and querying of diverse embedding products. By treating embeddings as first-class geospatial datasets, we decouple downstream analysis from model-specific engineering, providing a roadmap for more transparent and accessible Earth observation workflows."}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on LLM-driven refactoring using GPT-4o, applied to 100 Python classes from the ClassEval benchmark. Unlike prior work, our study explores a wide range of class-level refactorings inspired by Fowler's catalog and evaluates their effects from three complementary perspectives: (i) behavioral correctness, verified through unit tests; (ii) code quality, assessed via Pylint, Flake8, and SonarCloud; and (iii) readability, measured using a state-of-the-art readability tool.

To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention.

Token-oriented methods, such as pruning and skipping, have shown promise in reducing inference latency, but still suffer from inherently limited acceleration potential, outdated proxy signals, and redundancy interference, thus yielding suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose SPTS (Self-Predictive Token Skipping), a training-free framework for efficient long-context LLM inference. Specifically, motivated by the thought of probing the influence of targeted skipping layers, we design two component-specific strategies for selective token skipping: Partial Attention Probing (PAP) for multi-head attention, which selects informative tokens by performing partial forward attention computation, and Low-rank Transformation Probing (LTP) for feed forward network, which constructs a low-rank proxy network to predict token transformations. Furthermore, a Multi-Stage Delayed Pruning (MSDP) strategy reallocates the skipping budget and progressively prunes redundant tokens across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 2.46$\\times$ and 2.29$\\times$ speedups for prefilling and end-to-end generation, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art model performance.

We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes."}

Conversely, our FGSM-Neuro-Symbolic and PGD-Neuro-Symbolic models achieve substantially larger gains, improving adversarial accuracy by 18.1\\% and 17.35\\% over their corresponding adversarial-training baselines, representing roughly a three-fold larger robustness gain than standard adversarial training provides when both are measured relative to the same clean-training baseline, without reducing clean-sample accuracy. Compared to transformer-based defenses such as LNL-MoEx, which require heavy architectures and extensive data augmentation, our PGD-Neuro-Symbolic variant attains comparable or superior robustness using a ResNet18 backbone trained for 10 epochs. These results show that symbolic reasoning offers an effective path to robust and interpretable AI."}

Effective stimulation of motor neurons ideally requires the placement of SCS leads in the ventral or lateral epidural space where the corticospinal and rubrospinal motor fibers are located. This poses significant challenges with the current standard of manual steering. In this study, we present a static modeling approach for the ExoNav, a steerable robotic tool designed to facilitate precise navigation to the ventral and lateral epidural space. Cosserat rod framework is employed to establish the relationship between tendon actuation forces and the robot's overall shape. The effects of gravity, as an example of an external load, are investigated and implemented in the model and simulation. The experimental results indicate RMSE values of 1.76mm, 2.33mm, 2.18mm, and 1.33mm across four tested prototypes. Based on the helical shape of the ExoNav upon actuation, it is capable of performing follow-the-leader (FTL) motion by adding insertion and rotation DoFs to this robotic system, which is shown in simulation and experimentally. The proposed simulation has the capability to calculate optimum tendon tensions to follow the desired FTL paths while gravity-induced robot deformations are present. Three FTL experimental trials are conducted and the end-effector position showed repeatable alignments with the desired path with maximum RMSE value of 3.75mm. Ultimately, a phantom model demonstration is conducted where the teleoperated robot successfully navigated to the lateral and ventral spinal cord targets. Additionally, the user was able to navigate to the dorsal root ganglia, illustrating ExoNav's potential in both motor function recovery and pain management."}

Our novel benchmark PMR-Bench contains 1569 unique messages and 2,000+ high-quality test pairs for pairwise medical urgency assessment alongside a scalable training data generation pipeline.

Yet rigorous evaluation remains a significant challenge as static question-answer pairs provide only a snapshot of performance, compressing complex behavior into a single accuracy metric. This limitation is especially true in complex, rule-bound domains such as law, where existing benchmarks are costly to build and ill suited for isolating specific failure modes. To address this, we introduce OpenExempt, a framework and benchmark for diagnostic evaluation of legal reasoning. The OpenExempt Framework uses expert-crafted symbolic representations of U.S. Bankruptcy Code statutes to dynamically generate a large space of natural language reasoning tasks and their machine-computable solutions on demand. This gives users fine-grained control over task complexity and scope, allowing individual reasoning skills to be probed in isolation. Using this system, we construct the OpenExempt Benchmark, a diagnostic benchmark for legal reasoning with 9,765 samples across nine evaluation suites designed to carefully probe model capabilities. Experiments on 13 diverse language models reveal sharp performance cliffs that emerge only under longer reasoning paths and in the presence of obfuscating statements. We release the framework and benchmark publicly to support research aimed at understanding and improving the next generation of reasoning systems."}

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments."}

We learned that individuals conceptualize their companions based on an interplay of their beliefs about the companion's own agency and the autonomy permitted by the platform, how they pursue interactions with the companion, and the perceived initiatives that the companion takes. In combination with the external entities that affect relationship dynamics, particularly model updates that can derail companion behaviour and stability, individuals make use of different types of steering strategies to preserve their relationship, for example, by setting behavioural instructions or porting to other AI platforms.

To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers."}

While traditional methods rely on rigid, pre-defined flight paths and intensive offline processing, informative path planning (IPP) offers a way to collect data adaptively where it is most needed. Gaussian process (GP) mapping provides a continuous model of weed distribution with built-in uncertainty. However, GPs must be discretised for practical use in autonomous planning. Many discretisation techniques exist, but the impact of discrete representation choice remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how different discrete GP representations influence both mapping quality and mission-level performance in UAV-based weed mapping. Considering a UAV equipped with a downward-facing camera, we implement a receding-horizon IPP strategy that selects sampling locations based on the map uncertainty, travel cost, and coverage penalties. We investigate multiple discretisation strategies for representing the GP posterior and use their induced map partitions to generate candidate viewpoints for planning. Experiments on real-world weed distributions show that representation choice significantly affects exploration behaviour and efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that discretisation is not only a representational detail but a key design choice that shapes planning dynamics, coverage efficiency, and computational load in online UAV weed mapping."}

Their success hinges on directly manipulating the angle between features and class prototypes. However, this manipulation relies on the arccos function to recover the angle, introducing a significant yet overlooked source of training instability. The derivative of arccos explodes at its boundaries, causing gradient peaks during optimisation. Furthermore, the formulation fails to generate a sufficiently sharp gradient for hard-to-classify examples. We address these issues by proposing ChebyAAM, a loss that replaces the arccos operation with its Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This substitution eliminates gradient explosion and applies a stronger corrective signal to hard examples, leading to more effective optimisation. Experiments on three benchmarks (VoxCeleb, SITW, and CN-Celeb) demonstrate that our method resolves the instability and consistently improves performance. Our work suggests that approximating angular operations, rather than calculating them explicitly, offers a more robust path for designing future metric learning losses.

We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\\geq$95\\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning.

However, existing benchmarks largely ignore the temporal information inherent in images, which can further constrain the location. To bridge this gap, we introduce GTPred, a novel benchmark for geo-temporal prediction. GTPred comprises 370 globally distributed images spanning over 120 years. We evaluate MLLM predictions by jointly considering year and hierarchical location sequence matching, and further assess intermediate reasoning chains using meticulously annotated ground-truth reasoning processes. Experiments on 8 proprietary and 7 open-source MLLMs show that, despite strong visual perception, current models remain limited in world knowledge and geo-temporal reasoning. Results also demonstrate that incorporating temporal information significantly enhances location inference performance."}

We propose the Additive U-Net, which replaces concatenative skips with gated additive connections.

Evaluations on the Kodak-17 denoising benchmark show that Additive U-Net achieves competitive PSNR/SSIM at noise levels σ = 15, 25, 50, with robustness across kernel schedules and depths. Notably, effective denoising is achieved even without explicit down/up-sampling or forced hierarchies, as the model naturally learns a progression from high-frequency to band-pass to low-frequency features.

We assume that the instantaneous knowledge of the transmit signal at the sensing receiver is not available, and the sensing receiver only has knowledge of the statistical properties of the received signal. Unlike prior research that focuses on power allocation or optimal beamforming design for ISAC, we emphasize the inadequacy of the Cramér-Rao Bound (and its variant) in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, particularly in passive sensing scenarios. Due to severe path loss and other impairments, the received sensing SNR is often significantly lower than that of direct Line-of-Sight communication, making CRB-based performance evaluation unreliable. To address this, we adopt the Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) for Angle of Arrival estimation, which provides a more meaningful lower bound on estimation error. We derive analytical expressions for the ZZB and the achievable ergodic communication rate as functions of SNR. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the pareto-front between communication and sensing performance, demonstrating why ZZB serves as a better metric in low sensing SNR ISAC where traditional CRB-based approaches fail."}

Mr Dre consists of (1) a unified long-form report evaluation protocol spanning comprehensiveness, factuality, and presentation, and (2) a human-verified feedback simulation pipeline for multi-turn revision. Our analysis of five diverse DRAs reveals a critical limitation: while agents can address most user feedback, they also regress on 16-27% of previously covered content and citation quality.

This work streamlines automation in energy-aware configuration tuning and standardized green benchmarking deployable in CI/CD pipelines, thus empowering system architects with a spectrum of Pareto-optimal energy-compression-throughput trade-offs and actionable guidelines for building sustainable, efficient storage backends for massive open-source code archival."}

Implementing such program transformations is a non-trivial task, since it is necessary to iterate over the complete syntax tree and apply various transformations at nodes in a tree. In this paper we show how the features of functional logic programming are useful to implement program transformations in a compact and comprehensible manner. For this purpose, we propose to write program transformations as partially defined and non-deterministic operations. Since the implementation of non-determinism usually causes some overhead compared to deterministically defined operations, we compare our approach to a deterministic transformation method. We evaluate these alternatives for the functional logic language Curry and its intermediate representation FlatCurry which is used in various analysis and verification tools and compilers."}

Despite the importance of such blended emotions, most video-based emotion recognition approaches are designed to recognize single emotions only. The few approaches that have attempted to recognize blended emotions typically cannot assess the relative salience of the emotions within a blend. This limitation largely stems from the lack of datasets containing a substantial number of blended emotion samples annotated with relative salience. To address this shortcoming, we introduce BLEMORE, a novel dataset for multimodal (video, audio) blended emotion recognition that includes information on the relative salience of each emotion within a blend. BLEMORE comprises over 3,000 clips from 58 actors, performing 6 basic emotions and 10 distinct blends, where each blend has 3 different salience configurations (50/50, 70/30, and 30/70). Using this dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification approaches on two blended emotion prediction tasks: (1) predicting the presence of emotions in a given sample, and (2) predicting the relative salience of emotions in a blend. Our results show that unimodal classifiers achieve up to 29% presence accuracy and 13% salience accuracy on the validation set, while multimodal methods yield clear improvements, with ImageBind + WavLM reaching 35% presence accuracy and HiCMAE 18% salience accuracy. On the held-out test set, the best models achieve 33% presence accuracy (VideoMAEv2 + HuBERT) and 18% salience accuracy (HiCMAE). In sum, the BLEMORE dataset provides a valuable resource to advancing research on emotion recognition systems that account for the complexity and significance of blended emotion expressions."}

In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted.

However, their formulation-predicting one part of a sequence from another within a single-step dependency-limits modeling depth and often yields lower sample quality and stability than autoregressive (AR) models. To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction. Experiments on question answering, commonsense reasoning, and story infilling demonstrate that A3 outperforms diffusion-based models while maintaining flexible decoding. This work offers a unified approach for a flexible, efficient, and novel language modeling paradigm."}

We explore a fully iterative, matrix-free-compatible approach to the local patch solve using $p$-multigrid techniques. We evaluate different local solver configurations: Braess-Sarazin and block-triangular preconditioners. Our numerical experiments suggest that the Braess-Sarazin approach is particularly resilient.

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials."}

We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses.

However, their robustness to real-world weather conditions, and the stability of cross-modal semantic alignment under such structured perturbations, remain insufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts."}

To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A).

Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal.

In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning. Second, tuning gains are brittle under distribution shift. Our results show that base models surpass instruction-tuned variants on the domain-specific MedCalc benchmark. Additionally, instruction-tuned models show sharp declines on perturbed datasets, indicating sensitivity to prompt structure over robust reasoning."}

We dub this as \"recampaigning\" to capture the intuition that a party would redirect their campaigning efforts from one district to another. We model recampaigning as a computational problem, consider natural variations of the model, and study those new models through the lens of (1) (polynomial-time many-one) interreducibilities, (2) separations/collapses (both unconditional and axiomatic-sufficient), and (3) both worst-case and parametrized complexity."}

Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback.

However, efficiently leveraging tactile data for estimation remains a challenge due to partial observability, with single observations corresponding to multiple possible contact configurations. This limits conventional estimation approaches largely tailored to vision. We propose to address these challenges by learning an inverse tactile sensor model using denoising diffusion. The model is conditioned on tactile observations from a distributed tactile sensor and trained in simulation using a geometric sensor model based on signed distance fields. Contact constraints are enforced during inference through single-step projection using distance and gradient information from the signed distance field. For online pose estimation, we integrate the inverse model with a particle filter through a proposal scheme that combines generated hypotheses with particles from the prior belief. Our approach is validated in simulated and real-world planar pose estimation settings, without access to visual data or tight initial pose priors. We further evaluate robustness to unmodeled contact and sensor dynamics for pose tracking in a box-pushing scenario. Compared to local sampling baselines, the inverse sensor model improves sampling efficiency and estimation accuracy while preserving multimodal beliefs across objects with varying tactile discriminability."}

Representative benchmark problems--including Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman and Black--Scholes equations in up to 1000 dimensions --illustrate the scalability, effectiveness, and accuracy of the methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future directions for reliable and scalable solvers of high dimensional PDEs."}

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Tokenization underlies every large language model, yet it remains an under-theorized and inconsistently designed component. Common subword approaches such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) offer scalability but often misalign with linguistic structure, amplify bias, and waste capacity across languages and domains. This paper reframes tokenization as a core modeling decision rather than a preprocessing step. We argue for a context-aware framework that integrates tokenizer and model co-design, guided by linguistic, domain, and deployment considerations. Standardized evaluation and transparent reporting are essential to make tokenization choices accountable and comparable. Treating tokenization as a core design problem, not a technical afterthought, can yield language technologies that are fairer, more efficient, and more adaptable."}

The query complexity is well understood on grids, but much less is known beyond. This abstract problem captures many optimization tasks, such as finding a local minimum of a loss function during neural network training.\n  For each graph with $n$ vertices, we prove a deterministic upper bound of $O(t n^{1/t} (sΔ)^{1-1/t})$, where $s$ is the separation number and $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We complement this result with a randomized lower bound of $Ω(t n^{1/t}-t)$ that holds for any connected graph.

We present a SAT-based function-recovery attack that reconstructs hidden gate operations from a circuit's public topology. To enable recovery on larger and more complex circuits, we develop an incremental SAT-solving framework combined with a set of composable, topology-preserving simplification theorems.

Well-calibrated confidence enables downstream systems to decide when to trust a model and when to defer to fallback mechanisms. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of calibration in two widely used fine-tuning paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives. Based on this insight, we propose a calibration-aware reinforcement learning formulation that directly adjusts decision-token probabilities. Our method preserves RLVR's accuracy level while mitigating overconfidence, reducing ECE scores up to 9 points."}

Unlike the standard fair division model, agents may derive positive or negative utility not only from items allocated directly to them, but also from items allocated to other agents. Since exact envy-freeness cannot be guaranteed, prior work has focused on its relaxations. However, two central questions remained open: does there always exist an allocation that is envy-free up to one item (EF1), and if not, what is the optimal relaxation EF-$k$ that can always be attained?\n  We settle both questions by deriving tight asymptotic bounds on the number of items sufficient to eliminate envy. We show that for any instance with $n$ agents, an allocation that is envy-free up to $O(\\sqrt{n})$ items always exists and can be found in polynomial time, and we prove a matching $Ω(\\sqrt{n})$ lower bound showing that this result is tight even for binary valuations, which rules out the existence of EF1 allocations when agents have externalities."}

We instead reuse computation already paid for by the serving LLM: we train lightweight probes on its hidden states and predict labels in the same forward pass used for generation. We frame classification as representation selection over the full token-layer hidden-state tensor, rather than committing to a fixed token or fixed layer (e.g., first-token logits or final-layer pooling). To implement this, we introduce a two-stage aggregator that (i) summarizes tokens within each layer and (ii) aggregates across layer summaries to form a single representation for classification. We instantiate this template with direct pooling, a 100K-parameter scoring-attention gate, and a downcast multi-head self-attention (MHA) probe with up to 35M trainable parameters. Across safety and sentiment benchmarks our probes improve over logit-only reuse (e.g., MULI) and are competitive with substantially larger task-specific baselines, while preserving near-serving latency and avoiding the VRAM and latency costs of a separate guard-model pipeline."}

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114).

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

Using the state-of-the-art $α,β$-CROWN verifier, we evaluate ResNet4 models across varying pruning ratios on MNIST and, more importantly, on the NASA JPL Mars Frost Identification datasets.

However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments."}

Our reduction augments the system with prophecy timer variables that predict the number of steps along a trace until the next time certain temporal formulas, including the negated property, hold. In contrast to standard tableaux-based reductions, which reduce the problem to fair termination, our reduction does not introduce fairness assumptions. To verify termination of the augmented system, we follow the traditional approach of assigning each state a rank from a well-founded set and showing that the rank decreases in every transition. We leverage the recently proposed formalism of implicit rankings to express and automatically verify the decrease of rank using SMT solvers, even when the rank is not expressible in first-order logic. We extend implicit rankings from finite to infinite domains, enabling verification of more general systems and making them applicable to the augmented systems generated by our reduction, which allows us to exploit the decrease of timers in termination proofs. We evaluate our technique on a range of temporal verification tasks from previous works, giving simple, intuitive proofs for them within our framework."}

Peptide binder generation is critical in therapeutic and biochemical applications, yet many existing methods rely heavily on intermediate structure prediction, adding complexity and limiting sequence diversity. Our approach departs from this paradigm by generating binder sequences directly in a continuous latent space derived from a pretrained protein embedding model, without relying on predicted structures, thereby improving structural and sequence diversity. To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space. We evaluate PepEDiff on TIGIT, a challenging target with a large, flat protein-protein interaction interface that lacks a druggable pocket.

This tokenization premium results in increased API and energy costs and reduced effective context windows for these languages. In this paper we analyze the tokenizers of ten popular LMs to better understand their designs and per-language tokenization premiums. We also propose a mechanism to reduce tokenization premiums in pre-trained models, by post-hoc additions to the token vocabulary that coalesce multi-token characters into single tokens. We apply this methodology to 12 low-resource languages, demonstrating that the original and compressed inputs often have similar last hidden states when run through the Llama 3.2 1B model."}

Despite this, evidence suggests that study registrations frequently go unexamined, minimizing their effectiveness. In a way this is no surprise: manually checking registrations against papers is labour- and time-intensive, requiring careful reading across formats and expertise across domains. The advent of AI unlocks new possibilities in facilitating this activity. We present RegCheck, a modular LLM-assisted tool designed to help researchers, reviewers, and editors from across scientific disciplines compare study registrations with their corresponding papers. Importantly, RegCheck keeps human expertise and judgement in the loop by (i) ensuring that users are the ones who determine which features should be compared, and (ii) presenting the most relevant text associated with each feature to the user, facilitating (rather than replacing) human discrepancy judgements. RegCheck also generates shareable reports with unique RegCheck IDs, enabling them to be easily shared and verified by other users. RegCheck is designed to be adaptable across scientific domains, as well as registration and publication formats. In this paper we provide an overview of the motivation, workflow, and design principles of RegCheck, and we discuss its potential as an extensible infrastructure for reproducible science with an example use case."}

Despite recent advances, existing methods often lack effective integration of histological morphology with molecular profiles, relying on shallow fusion strategies or omitting tissue images altogether, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous spatial domain boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue. MultiST yields spatial domains with clearer and more coherent boundaries than existing methods, leading to more stable pseudotime trajectories and more biologically interpretable cell-cell interaction patterns.

The earlier approach modeled code as attention-ready sequences that blended lightweight structure with behavioral context; however, it lacked explicit role disambiguation within classes and treated call edges uniformly. SEER addresses these limitations with two principled additions: (i) a spectral-entropy role encoder that derives per-member role embeddings from the Laplacian spectrum of each class's interaction graph, and (ii) a time-weighted calling context that assigns empirically calibrated duration priors to method categories (e.g., constructors, getters/setters, static calls, virtual dispatch, cloning). Together, these components sharpen the model's notion of \"who does what\" and \"how much it matters,\" while remaining portable across languages with minimal adaptation and fully compatible with Transformer-based sequence encoders. Importantly, SEER does not \"force\" a win by capacity or data; it nudges the classifier, steering attention toward role-consistent and temporally calibrated signals that matter most. We evaluate SEER on PyDesignNet (1,832 files, 35,000 sequences, 23 GoF patterns) and observe consistent gains over our previous system: macro-F1 increases from 92.47% to 93.20% and accuracy from 92.52% to 93.98%, with macro-precision 93.98% and macro-recall 92.52%. Beyond aggregate metrics, SEER reduces false positives by nearly 20%, a decisive improvement that strengthens its robustness and practical reliability. Moreover, SEER yields interpretable, symbol-level attributions aligned with canonical roles, exhibits robustness under small graph perturbations, and shows stable calibration."}

Scaling commutativity reasoning to routinely-used features in software systems, such as procedures and parallel composition, remains a significant challenge.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel reduction technique for structured concurrent programs that unifies two key advances. First, we present a reduction strategy that soundly replaces parallel composition with sequential composition. Second, we generalize Lipton's reduction to support atomic sections containing (potentially recursive) procedure calls. Crucially, these two foundational strategies can be composed arbitrarily, greatly expanding the scope and flexibility of reduction-based reasoning. We implemented this technique in Civl and demonstrated its effectiveness on a number of challenging case studies, including a snapshot object, a fault-tolerant and linearizable register, the FLASH cache coherence protocol, and a non-trivial variant of Two-Phase Commit."}

Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps.

The core difficulty lies in the arbitrary and intricate distribution of vertices in 3D space, making it challenging for existing models to establish clean connectivity and resulting in suboptimal geometry. To address this, our core insight is to simplify the underlying geometric structure by constraining the distribution onto a simple and regular manifold, a topological sphere. Building on this, we first propose the Spherical Geometry Representation, a novel face representation that anchors geometric signals to uniform spherical coordinates. This guarantees a regular point distribution, from which the mesh connectivity can be robustly reconstructed. Critically, this canonical sphere can be seamlessly unwrapped into a 2D map, creating a perfect synergy with powerful 2D generative models. We then introduce Spherical Geometry Diffusion, a conditional diffusion framework built upon this 2D map. It enables diverse and controllable generation by jointly modeling geometry and texture, where the geometry explicitly conditions the texture synthesis process. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through its success in a wide range of tasks: text-to-3D generation, face reconstruction, and text-based 3D editing. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods in geometric quality, textual fidelity, and inference efficiency."}

Despite being regarded as a significant step toward regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and its emphasis on fundamental rights, the EU AI Act is not immune to moral criticism regarding its ethical foundations. Our work examines the impact of three major normative theories of ethics, virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and consequentialism, on the EU AI Act. We introduce the concept of influence, grounded in philosophical and chronological analysis, to examine the underlying relationship between the theories and the Act. As a proxy measure of this influence, we propose using STS to quantify the degree of alignment between the theories (influencers) and the Act (influencee). To capture intentional and operational ethical consistency, the Act was divided into two parts: the preamble and the statutory provisions. The textual descriptions of the theories were manually preprocessed to reduce semantic overlap and ensure a distinct representation of each theory. A heterogeneous embedding-level ensemble approach was employed, using five modified Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models built on the Transformer architecture to compute STS scores. These scores reflect the semantic alignment between various theories of ethics and the two components of the EU AI Act. The resulting similarity scores were evaluated using voting and averaging, with findings indicating that deontological ethics has the most significant overall influence."}

This paper presents a fully model-driven 4D radar perception framework designed for real-time execution on embedded edge hardware. The system uses radar as its sole perception modality and integrates domain aware multi threshold filtering, ego motion compensated temporal accumulation, KD tree Euclidean clustering with Doppler aware refinement, and a rule based 3D classifier. The framework is evaluated in a dust filled enclosed trailer and in real underground mining tunnels, and in the tested scenarios the radar based detector maintains stable pedestrian identification as camera and LiDAR modalities fail under severe visibility degradation. These results suggest that the proposed model-driven approach provides robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient perception for safety-critical applications in harsh industrial and subterranean environments."}

However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance."}

While Chat LLMs offer safety and Agentic workflows provide flexibility, they suffer from performance degradation and prohibitive latency, respectively. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that with minimal data (20k samples), SRI-Coder enables Chat models to surpass the completion performance of their Base counterparts. Crucially, unlike FIM-style tuning, SRI preserves general coding competencies and maintains inference latency comparable to standard FIM. We empower the entire Qwen3-Coder series with SRI, encouraging the developer community to leverage this framework for advanced auto-completion and assisted development."}

This study used the two largest publicly available chest CT datasets: CT-RATE and RADCHEST-CT (held-out external test set). Our carefully tuned supervised baseline (instantiated as a simple Global Average Pooling head) establishes a new supervised state of the art, surpassing all reported linear-probe VLMs. Building on this baseline, we present ORACLE-CT, an encoder-agnostic, organ-aware head that pairs Organ-Masked Attention (mask-restricted, per-organ pooling that yields spatial evidence) with Organ-Scalar Fusion (lightweight fusion of normalized volume and mean-HU cues). In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85.

Despite strong performance, existing confidence estimation methods typically reduce an entire reasoning process to a single scalar score, ignoring how confidence evolves throughout the generation. As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show our confidence scores are more calibrated than the baselines."}

Most individual-level SDOH data is collected through structured screening tools, which lack the flexibility to capture the complexity of patient experiences and unique needs of a clinic's population. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured SDOH information from unstructured patient life stories and evaluate the predictive value of both the extracted features and the narratives themselves for assessing diabetes control. We collected unstructured interviews from 65 T2D patients aged 65 and older, focused on their lived experiences, social context, and diabetes management. These narratives were analyzed using LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation to produce concise, actionable qualitative summaries for clinical interpretation and structured quantitative SDOH ratings for risk prediction modeling. The structured SDOH ratings were used independently and in combination with traditional laboratory biomarkers as inputs to linear and tree-based machine learning models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to demonstrate how unstructured narrative data can be applied in conventional risk prediction workflows. Finally, we evaluated several LLMs on their ability to predict a patient's level of diabetes control (low, medium, high) directly from interview text with A1C values redacted. LLMs achieved 60% accuracy in predicting diabetes control levels from interview text. This work demonstrates how LLMs can translate unstructured SDOH-related data into structured insights, offering a scalable approach to augment clinical risk models and decision-making."}

We define formal indicators that quantify performance degradation caused by internal execution variability and external environmental disturbances, respectively. These indicators are then applied to assess multiple eco-driving controllers through real-world vehicle experiments. The results reveal key tradeoffs between tracking accuracy and adaptability, showing that optimization-based controllers offer more consistent performance across varying disturbance levels, while analytical controllers may perform comparably under nominal conditions but exhibit greater sensitivity to execution and timing variability."}

Models achieve perfect accuracy on factual questions and 84-90% on seen tasks. However, accuracy drops sharply on unseen problems (by 30-64%), with failures stemming from systematic misinterpretation of language constraints, incorrect handling of Kleene-star semantics, and a failure to preserve global consistency. We evaluate a three-stage hint protocol that enables correction of shallow errors but does not reliably resolve globally inconsistent or structurally flawed automata. Our analysis across multiple prompting strategies (direct, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought) reveals that errors persist regardless of prompting approach, exposing a fundamental gap between LLMs' ability to generate syntactically plausible DFAs and their capacity for semantically correct formal reasoning."}

First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs. Our work reveals that, for quantitative spatial reasoning, architectural decoupling enables better accuracy on quantitative tasks."}

Recent GAN- and diffusion-based enhancement methods improve perceptual quality by aligning degraded images with high-quality distributions, but our analysis shows that this focus can distort intra-class geometry: clinically related samples become dispersed, disease-class boundaries blur, and downstream tasks such as grading or lesion detection are harmed. The Gromov Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy offers a principled solution by aligning distributions through internal pairwise distances, naturally preserving intra-class structure, but its high computational cost restricts practical use. To overcome this, we propose SGW-GAN, the first framework to incorporate Sliced GW (SGW) into retinal image enhancement. SGW approximates GW via random projections, retaining relational fidelity while greatly reducing cost. Experiments on public datasets show that SGW-GAN produces visually compelling enhancements, achieves superior diabetic retinopathy grading, and reports the lowest GW discrepancy across disease labels, demonstrating both efficiency and clinical fidelity for unpaired medical image enhancement."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

Among these techniques, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a complex method of attack aimed at specific targets to steal high-value sensitive information or damage the infrastructure of the targeted organization. In this paper, I will investigate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) as a modern attack technique, focusing on both the attack life cycle and cutting-edge detection and defense strategies proposed in recent academic research. I will analyze four representative papers to understand the evolution of APT detection mechanisms, including machine learning-driven behavioral analysis and network-level collaborative defense models.

Our results reveal that models are increasingly susceptible to incorrect/misleading endorsements as source expertise increases, with higher-authority sources inducing not only accuracy degradation but also increased confidence in wrong answers.

Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands.

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of VLM-based approaches for anomaly classification (AC) and anomaly segmentation (AS). We systematically investigate key architectural paradigms including sliding window-based dense feature extraction (WinCLIP), multi-stage feature alignment with learnable projections (AprilLab framework), and compositional prompt ensemble strategies. Our analysis evaluates these methods across critical dimensions: feature extraction mechanisms, text-visual alignment strategies, prompt engineering techniques, zero-shot versus few-shot trade-offs, computational efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Through rigorous experimentation on benchmarks such as MVTec AD and VisA, we compare classification accuracy, segmentation precision, and inference efficiency. The primary contribution is a foundational understanding of how and why VLMs succeed in anomaly detection, synthesizing practical insights for method selection and identifying current limitations.

This version corresponds to the initial public release of the CUA architecture and associated evaluation metrics", "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of AI-assisted reasoning across scientific, technical, and organizational domains. However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure."}

The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry. The framework achieves high reconstruction fidelity, with surface distance errors concentrated within $1\\%$ of the maximum blade dimension, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen designs. By integrating constraints, objectives, and performance metrics, this approach advances beyond traditional 2D-guided or unconstrained 3D pipelines, offering a practical and interpretable solution for data-driven turbine blade modeling and concept generation."}

The proposed architecture employs a dual-pathway approach: an ANN component processes static spatial features at low frequency, while an SNN component handles dynamic, event-based sensor data in real time. Unlike conventional hybrid architectures that rely on domain conversion mechanisms, our system incorporates a pre-developed SNN-based filter that directly utilizes spike-encoded inputs for localization and state estimation. Detected anomalies are validated using contextual information from the ANN pathway and continuously tracked to support anticipatory navigation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers acceptable detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency close to SNN-only implementations, which operate at a fraction of the resource cost.

Before the reform, data.table faced a growing backlog of unresolved issues and open pull requests, unclear contributor pathways, and bottlenecks caused by reliance on a single core maintainer. In response, the community initiated a redesign of its governance structure. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of this transition through a mixed-methods approach, combining a contributor survey (n=17) with mining project repository data. Our results show that following the reform, the project experienced a 200% increase in new contributor recruitment, a drop in pull request resolution time from over 700 days to under a week, and a 3x increase in contributor retention. Community sentiment improved around transparency, onboarding, and project momentum, though concerns around fairness and conflict resolution remain. This case study provides practical guidance for maintainers, companies, and foundations seeking to enhance OSS governance."}

However, real-world EV datasets are often plagued by missing records, and existing imputation methods are ill-equipped for the complex, multimodal context of charging data, often relying on a restrictive one-model-per-station paradigm that ignores valuable inter-station correlations. To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance."}

Geometrically, such codes correspond to tilings of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ by the symmetric limited-magnitude error ball $\\mathcal{B}(n,e,s,s)$. Given $n$ and $s$, we adapt the geometric ideas underlying the Elias bound for the Hamming metric to the distance $d_s$ tailed for this channel, and derive new necessary conditions on $e$ for the existence of perfect codes / tilings, without assuming any lattice structure. Our main results identify two distinct regimes depending on the error magnitude. For small error magnitudes ($s \\in \\{1, 2\\}$), we prove that if the number of correctable errors does not exceed a certain fraction of $n$, then it is asymptotically bounded by $e = \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$. In contrast, for larger magnitudes ($s \\geq 3$), we establish a significantly sharper bound of $e < \\sqrt{12.36n}$, which holds without any restriction on $e$ being below a given fraction of $n$.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare."}

We examined psychosocial wellbeing, in terms of affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that news engagement produces systematic trade-offs: increased depression, stress, and anxiety, yet decreased loneliness and increased social interaction on the platform. Regression models reveal that News feed bookmarking is associated with greater psychosocial deterioration compared to commenting or quoting, with magnitude differences exceeding tenfold.

However, the true accuracy of these regret estimates remains unclear. Computing exact regret is computationally intractable, and current models rely on gradient based optimizers whose outcomes depend heavily on hyperparameter choices. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing methods systematically underestimate actual regret (In some models, the true regret is several hundred times larger than the reported regret), leading to overstated claims of IC and revenue. To address this issue, we derive a lower bound on regret and introduce an efficient item wise regret approximation. Building on this, we propose a guided refinement procedure that substantially improves regret estimation accuracy while reducing computational cost. Our method provides a more reliable foundation for evaluating incentive compatibility in deep learning based auction mechanisms and highlights the need to reassess prior performance claims in this area."}

We present the RASC (Request-Acknowledge-Start-Complete) abstraction, which provides acknowledgments at critical points after an IoT device action is initiated. RASC is a better fit for IoT actions, which naturally vary in length spatially (across devices) and temporally (across time, for a given device). RASC also enables the design of several new features: predicting action completion times accurately, detecting failures of actions faster, allowing fine-grained dependencies in programming, and scheduling. RASC is intended to be implemented atop today's available RPC mechanisms, rather than as a replacement. We integrated RASC into a popular and open-source IoT framework called Home Assistant. Our trace-driven evaluation finds that RASC meets latency SLOs, especially for long actions that last O(mins), which are common in smart spaces. Our scheduling policies for home automations (e.g., routines) outperform state-of-the-art counterparts by 10%-55%."}

We present a physics-grounded processing pipeline that maps event streams to estimates of per-pixel log-intensity and intensity derivatives, and embeds these measurements in a dynamic linear systems model with a time-varying point spread function. This enables inverse filtering directly from event data, using frequency-domain Wiener deconvolution with a known (or parameterised) dynamic transfer function.

Offline, we exploit compositionality to enable incremental synthesis: combining ConSTels for simpler objectives into non-conflicting templates for more complex combined objectives.

Using data from 1966 to 2024, we classify incidents according to whether the perpetrator died at the scene or survived the attack. Using a bivariate Hawkes process, we quantify the cross-excitation effect, which is the triggering effect that each event type exerts on the other, i.e., \"die at the scene\"$\\rightarrow$ \"live\" and \"live\"$\\rightarrow$ \"die at the scene\", as well as the self-excitation effects, i.e., \"die at the scene\"$\\rightarrow$ \"die at the scene\" and \"live\"$\\rightarrow$ \"live\". Our results show that the strongest spillover was from \"live\" incidents to \"die at the scene\", where we estimate that 0.34 (0.09, 0.80) of \"die at the scene\" incidents are triggered by a prior event in which the offender survived the attack. This pathway also exhibits the longest estimated contagion timescale: approximately 20 days. In contrast, the reverse influence, that is, \"die at the scene\"$\\rightarrow$\"live\", is not statistically significant, with the lower bound of its 95% confidence interval nearly equal to zero. We also find that \"die at the scene\" events can only cause their own type, where 0.139 (0.01, 0.52) of such incidents are caused by previous \"die at the scene\" events, with the shortest contagion timescale of roughly 20 hours."}

The challenge is exacerbated by the RS highly heterogeneous data and huge scale variation. Consequently, paradigms proven effective in other domains often fail when confronted with these unique data characteristics. Conventional disentanglement learning, which relies on significant feature overlap between modalities (modality-invariant), is insufficient for this heterogeneity. Similarly, knowledge distillation becomes an ill-posed mimicry task where a student fails to focus on the necessary compensatory knowledge, leaving the semantic gap unaddressed. Our work is therefore built upon three pillars uniquely designed for RS: (1) principled missing information compensation, (2) class-specific modality contribution, and (3) multi-resolution feature importance. We propose a novel method DIS2, a new paradigm shifting from modality-shared feature dependence and untargeted imitation to active, guided missing features compensation. Its core novelty lies in a reformulated synergy between disentanglement learning and knowledge distillation, termed DLKD. Compensatory features are explicitly captured which, when fused with the features of the available modality, approximate the ideal fused representation of the full-modality case. To address the class-specific challenge, our Classwise Feature Learning Module (CFLM) adaptively learn discriminative evidence for each target depending on signal availability. Both DLKD and CFLM are supported by a hierarchical hybrid fusion (HF) structure using features across resolutions to strengthen prediction. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks."}

Anonpsy (1) converts each narrative into a semantic graph encoding clinical entities, temporal anchors, and typed relations; (2) applies graph-constrained perturbations that modify identifying context while preserving clinically essential structure; and (3) regenerates text via graph-conditioned LLM generation. Evaluated on 90 clinician-authored psychiatric case narratives, Anonpsy preserves diagnostic fidelity while achieving consistently low re-identification risk under expert, semantic, and GPT-5-based evaluations.

In this paper, we propose STARCRS, a Screen-Text-AwaRe Conversational Recommender System that integrates two complementary text understanding modes: (1) a screen-reading pathway that encodes auxiliary textual information as visual tokens, mimicking skim reading on a screen, and (2) an LLM-based textual pathway that focuses on a limited set of critical content for fine-grained reasoning.

Cross-lagged panel analyses further show that teacher help recurred across sessions, whereas idle behavior did not receive sustained attention over time. Finally, help coincided with immediate learning within sessions, but did not predict skill acquisition in later sessions, as estimated by additive factor modeling. These findings suggest that teacher help is \"sticky\" in that it recurs for previously supported students, while its measurable learning benefits in our data are largely session-bound. We discuss implications for designing real-time analytics that track attention coverage and highlight under-visited students to support a more equitable and effective allocation of teacher attention."}

Among various tensor models, low-Tucker-rank tensors are particularly attractive for capturing multi-mode subspace structures in high-dimensional data. Existing recovery methods either operate on the full tensor variable with expensive tensor projections, or adopt factorized formulations that still rely on full-gradient computations, while most stochastic factorized approaches are restricted to tensor decomposition settings. In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors. Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines."}

Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data.

Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance. Further analyses also demonstrate its practical deployment value and research potential."}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

In the present work, we extend SINDy to identify distributed-delay differential equations by incorporating the Linear Chain Trick (LCT), which provides a finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation representing the distributed memory effects. Hence, SINDy can operate in an augmented state space using conventional sparse regression while preserving a clear interpretation of delayed influences via the chain trick. From time-series data, the proposed method jointly infers the governing equations, the mean delay, and the dispersion of the underlying delay distribution. We numerically verify the method on several models with distributed delay, including the logistic growth model and a Hes1--mRNA gene regulatory network model. We show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs distributed delay dynamics, remains robust under noise and sparse sampling, and provides a transparent, data-driven approach for discovering nonlinear systems with distributed-delay."}

Drawing inspiration from the framing effect in psychology, we systematically investigate how deliberate prompt framing skews model judgments across four high-stakes evaluation tasks. We design symmetric prompts using predicate-positive and predicate-negative constructions and demonstrate that such framing induces significant discrepancies in model outputs. Across 14 LLM judges, we observe clear susceptibility to framing, with model families showing distinct tendencies toward agreement or rejection. These findings suggest that framing bias is a structural property of current LLM-based evaluation systems, underscoring the need for framing-aware protocols."}

This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state.

Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design."}

We prove that coherence optimization is equivalent to description-length regularization, and that among all such regularization schemes, it is optimal for semi-supervised learning when the regularizer is derived from a pretrained model.

Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks. Additionally, we develop a structure-aware editor that resolves the issue of latent modifications into discrete graph edits, ensuring robustness against structural perturbations. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of DRGW."}

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains."}

Traditional dynamic pricing models, often relying on deterministic EV-CS pairings and network equilibrium assumptions, frequently oversimplify user behavior and lack scalability. This study proposes a stochastic, behaviorally heterogeneous dynamic pricing framework formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The upper level optimizes time-varying pricing to maximize system-wide utility, while the lower level models decentralized EV users via a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model incorporating price sensitivity, battery aging, risk attitudes, and network travel costs. Crucially, the model avoids network equilibrium constraints to enhance scalability, with congestion effects represented via queuing-theoretic approximations. To efficiently solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem, a rolling-horizon approach combining the Dynamic Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis-guided Cross-Entropy Method (PSA-CEM) with the Method of Successive Averages (MSA) is implemented. A real-world case study in Clayton, Melbourne, validates the framework using 22 charging stations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism substantially reduces queuing penalties and improves user utility compared to fixed and time-of-use pricing. The framework provides a robust, scalable tool for strategic EV charging management, balancing realism with computational efficiency."}

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains."}

Traditional rumor detection relied primarily on manual analysis. With the continuous advancement of technology, machine learning and deep learning approaches for rumor identification have gradually emerged and gained prominence. However, previous approaches often struggle to simultaneously capture both the sequential and the global structural relationships among topological nodes within a social network. To tackle this issue, we introduce a hybrid model for detecting rumors that integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a Transformer architecture, aiming to leverage the complementary strengths of structural and semantic feature extraction. Positional encoding helps preserve the sequential order of these nodes within the propagation structure. The use of Multi-head attention mechanisms enables the model to capture features across diverse representational subspaces, thereby enhancing both the richness and depth of text comprehension. This integration allows the framework to concurrently identify the key propagation network of rumors, the textual content, the long-range dependencies, and the sequence among propagation nodes. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets, including Twitter 15 and Twitter 16, demonstrate that our proposed fusion model significantly outperforms both standalone models and existing mainstream methods in terms of accuracy. These results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach for the rumor detection task."}

Conventional shape-aware membranes typically rely on resistive, capacitive, or magneto-sensitive mechanisms. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as structural complexity, limited compliance during large-scale deformation, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. This work presents a soft, flexible, and stretchable proprioceptive silicone membrane based on optical waveguide sensing. The membrane sensor integrates edge-mounted LEDs and centrally distributed photodiodes (PDs), interconnected via liquid-metal traces embedded within a multilayer elastomeric composite. Rich deformation-dependent light intensity signals are decoded by a data-driven model to recover the membrane geometry as a 3D point cloud. On a customized 140 mm square membrane, real-time reconstruction of large-scale out-of-plane deformation is achieved at 90 Hz with an average reconstruction error of 1.3 mm, measured by Chamfer distance, while maintaining accuracy for indentations up to 25 mm.

It then enforces dual constraints: feature orthogonal projection on both forgetting and remaining classes, while gradient orthogonal projection prevents the reintroduction of forgotten knowledge and disruption to remaining classes during updates. Additionally, dynamic subspace adaptation merges newly forgetting subspaces and contracts remaining subspaces, ensuring a stable balance between removal and retention across sequential unlearning tasks.

In compute-intensive scenarios, these models outperform the default Kubernetes scheduler as well as Transformer-and LSTM-based alternatives, reducing average CPU utilization per cluster node by 10%, and by over 20% when using SDQN-n. Moreover, our results show that SDQN-n approach of consolidating pods onto fewer nodes further amplifies resource savings and helps advance greener, more energy-efficient data centers.Therefore, pod scheduling must employ different strategies tailored to each scenario in order to achieve better performance.Since the reinforcement-learning components of the SDQN and SDQN-n architectures proposed in this paper can be easily tuned by adjusting their parameters, they can accommodate the requirements of various future scenarios."}

Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

However, their strict unidirectional block dependencies introduce irreversibility and sacrifice the global planning capabilities for which diffusion models are renowned. In order to address these issues, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a draft-then-refine framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using just 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models."}

We formalize this problem and show that verifying global consistency requires exponentially many oracle queries in the worst case. To make the task practical, we propose an adaptive divide-and-conquer algorithm that identifies minimal inconsistent subsets (MUSes) of facts and optionally computes minimal repairs through hitting-sets. Our approach has low-degree polynomial query complexity.

Considering a simplified model where the source distribution is multivariate Gaussian with a given covariance matrix, the explicit closed-form evolution trajectory of the distributions across reverse sampling steps is derived, and consequently, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source distribution and the reverse sampling output is obtained. The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling. Experiments across different datasets and pretrained models demonstrate that the time discretization strategy selected by our approach consistently outperforms baseline and search-based strategies, particularly when the budget on the number of function evaluations is very tight."}

On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis.

Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness.

To bridge this gap, we propose ChartVerse, a scalable framework designed to synthesize complex charts and reliable reasoning data from scratch.

Many modern black-box LRMs expose the intermediate reasoning traces through APIs to improve transparency (e.g., Gemini-2.5 and Claude-sonnet). Despite their benefits, we find that these traces can leak membership signals, creating a new privacy threat even without access to token logits used in prior attacks. In this work, we initiate the first systematic exploration of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on black-box LRMs. Our preliminary analysis shows that LRMs produce confident, recall-like reasoning traces on familiar training member samples but more hesitant, inference-like reasoning traces on non-members. The representations of these traces are continuously distributed in the semantic latent space, spanning from familiar to unfamiliar samples. Building on this observation, we propose BlackSpectrum, the first membership inference attack framework targeting the black-box LRMs. The key idea is to construct a recall-inference axis in the semantic latent space, based on representations derived from the exposed traces. By locating where a query sample falls along this axis, the attacker can obtain a membership score and predict how likely it is to be a member of the training data. Additionally, to address the limitations of outdated datasets unsuited to modern LRMs, we provide two new datasets to support future research, arXivReasoning and BookReasoning. Empirically, exposing reasoning traces significantly increases the vulnerability of LRMs to membership inference attacks, leading to large gains in attack performance. Our findings highlight the need for LRM companies to balance transparency in intermediate reasoning traces with privacy preservation."}

For the success of these platforms, it is crucial to design reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that not only increase the total number of matches but also avoid creating unfairness among users. In this paper, we investigate the fairness of RRSs on matching platforms. From the perspective of fair division, we define the users' opportunities to be recommended and establish the fairness concept of envy-freeness in the allocation of these opportunities. We first introduce the Social Welfare (SW) method, which approximately maximizes the number of matches, and show that it leads to significant unfairness in recommendation opportunities, illustrating the trade-off between fairness and match rates. To address this challenge, we propose the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) method, which alternately optimizes two NSW functions and achieves nearly envy-free recommendations. We further generalize the SW and NSW method to the $α$-SW method, which balances the trade-off between fairness and high match rates. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient approximation algorithm for the SW/NSW/$α$-SW methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach."}

In this paper, we propose a lightweight confidentiality-preserving framework that utilizes a quasi-group based All-Or-Nothing Transform (AONT) combined with secure multi-path routing in NoC-based SoCs. By applying AONT to each packet and distributing its transformed blocks across multiple non-overlapping routes, we ensure that no intermediate router can reconstruct the original data without all blocks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively mitigates eavesdropping attacks by malicious routers with negligible area and performance overhead. Our results also reveal that AONT-based multi-path routing can provide 7.3x reduction in overhead compared to traditional encryption for securing against eavesdropping attacks."}

Building on this separability, we propose Activation-space Anchored Access Control (AAAC), a training-free framework for multi-class permission control. AAAC constructs an anchor bank, with one permission anchor per class, from a small offline sample set and requires no fine-tuning. At inference time, a multi-anchor steering mechanism redirects each query's activations toward the anchor-defined authorized region associated with the current user, thereby suppressing over-privileged generations by design.

Offloading this shared prefix cache to secondary storage is essential for memory scalability. Re-Prefill with offloading suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks in two aspects. First, semantic-aware KV cache pruning algorithms select important tokens in fine granularity, while systems manage I/O in coarse, fixed-size blocks, causing severe read amplification. Second, the sequential dependency between identifying important tokens and loading KV cache creates idle I/O and compute bubbles, under-utilizing system resources.\n  This paper proposes \\textit{ContiguousKV}, a high-performance prefix KV cache offloading system that bridges algorithmic semantics with I/O efficiency to accelerate the Re-Prefill phase. We first introduce \\textit{ContiguousChunk}, a unified data management granularity that aligns KV cache pruning with I/O operations. All the mechanisms critical for I/O performance are performed at the granularity of ContiguousChunk, thereby eliminating read amplification. By exploiting the high similarity in important ContiguousChunk indices across layers, we propose intra- and inter-period asynchronous prefetching to break the sequential dependency between I/O and compute, effectively eliminating idle bubbles. Finally, we propose attention-guided cache management to retain semantically critical prefix data in memory.

Small VLMs fall behind larger VLMs in grounding because of the difference in language understanding capability rather than visual information handling. To mitigate the gap, we introduce 'Efficient visual Grounding language Models' (EGM): a method to scale the test-time computation (#generated tokens). Scaling the test-time computation of a small model is deployment-friendly, and yields better end-to-end latency as the cost of each token is much cheaper compared to directly running a large model. On the RefCOCO benchmark, our EGM-Qwen3-VL-8B demonstrates 91.4 IoU with an average of 737ms (5.9x faster) latency while Qwen3-VL-235B demands 4,320ms to achieve 90.5 IoU. To validate our approach's generality, we further set up a new amodal grounding setting that requires the model to predict both the visible and occluded parts of the objects.

Moreover, a multimodal optimal viewpoint prediction network is developed, leveraging cross-attention to align and fuse multimodal features and directly predict camera pose adjustments. The proposed framework is instantiated in robotic grasping under viewpoint-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that active perception guided by the framework significantly improves grasp success rates. Notably, real-world evaluations achieve nearly double the grasp success rate and enable seamless sim-to-real transfer without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

An Investigation into Language Bias of Pairwise LLM-as-a-Judge", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incentivized the development of LLM-as-a-judge, an application of LLMs where they are used as judges to decide the quality of a certain piece of text given a certain context. However, previous studies have demonstrated that LLM-as-a-judge can be biased towards different aspects of the judged texts, which often do not align with human preference. One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language. Finally, we investigate whether language bias is in fact caused by low-perplexity bias, a previously identified bias of LLM-as-a-judge, and we find that while perplexity is slightly correlated with language bias, language bias cannot be fully explained by perplexity only."}

Previous work achieved this with loss functions. Recent advancements in classification have shown that the discriminative ability of embeddings can be strengthened by imposing maximum class separation as inductive bias. This technique has never been used in the domain of face-voice association, and this work aims at filling this gap. More specifically, we develop a method for face-voice association that imposes maximum class separation among multimodal representations of different speakers as an inductive bias. Through quantitative experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it achieves SOTA performance on two task formulation of face-voice association. Furthermore, we carry out an ablation study to show that imposing inductive bias is most effective when combined with losses for inter-class orthogonality.

To teach the LLM-based Time Series Reasoning Models (TSRMs) strategic tool-use, we also collect a 100k expert trajectory corpus called TimeToolBench.

We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects. (2) Systemic Homogeneity: Root causes converge across divergent series, confirming reliability barriers are inherent to the shared ecosystem rather than specific architectures. (3) Lifecycle Escalation: Barriers escalate from intrinsic configuration struggles during fine-tuning to compounded environmental incompatibilities during inference.

Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization."}

The temporal version of that task, temporal knowledge graph extraction (TKGE), involves extracting temporally grounded facts from text, represented as semantic quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp). Many recent systems take advantage of large language models (LLMs), which are becoming a new cornerstone of the web due to their performance on many tasks across the natural language processing (NLP) field. Despite the importance of TKGE, existing datasets for training and evaluation remain scarce, and contamination of evaluation data is an unaddressed issue, potentially inflating LLMs' perceived performance due to overlaps between training and evaluation sets. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel synthetic evaluation dataset constructed from predicted future, previously unseen temporal facts, thereby eliminating contamination and enabling robust and unbiased benchmarking. Our dataset creation involves a two-step approach: (1) Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) generates plausible future quadruples, which are subsequently filtered to adhere to the original knowledge base schema; (2) LLMs perform quadruple-to-text generation, creating semantically aligned textual descriptions. We benchmark Extract, Define and Canonicalize (EDC), a state-of-the-art LLM-based extraction framework, demonstrating that LLM performance decreases when evaluated on our dataset compared to a dataset of known facts. We publicly release our dataset consisting of 4.2K future quadruples and corresponding textual descriptions, along with the generation methodology, enabling continuous creation of unlimited future temporal datasets to serve as long-term, contamination-free benchmarks for TKGE."}

For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines. Ablation analysis studies confirm the necessity and interpretability of the design."}

This makes it a promising approach for achieving low-latency and robust data delivery in highly dynamic LEO networks. Specifically, we formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem and employ a residual reinforcement learning framework to optimize opportunistic routing for reducing transmission delay.

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware.

We introduce Class-stratified Scheduled Power Predictive Entropy (ClaSP PE), a simple and effective query strategy that addresses two key limitations of standard uncertainty-based AL methods: class imbalance and redundancy in early selections. ClaSP PE combines class-stratified querying to ensure coverage of underrepresented structures and log-scale power noising with a decaying schedule to enforce query diversity in early-stage AL and encourage exploitation later. In our evaluation on 24 experimental settings using four 3D biomedical datasets within the comprehensive nnActive benchmark, ClaSP PE is the only method that generally outperforms improved random baselines in terms of both segmentation quality with statistically significant gains, whilst remaining annotation efficient. Furthermore, we explicitly simulate the real-world application by testing our method on four previously unseen datasets without manual adaptation, where all experiment parameters are set according to predefined guidelines. The results confirm that ClaSP PE robustly generalizes to novel tasks without requiring dataset-specific tuning. Within the nnActive framework, we present compelling evidence that an AL method can consistently outperform random baselines adapted to 3D segmentation, in terms of both performance and annotation efficiency in a realistic, close-to-production scenario.

Evaluating against the entire pool of solutions ($1.1 \\times 10^7$ in total), our dataset achieves an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of $89.37\\%$ and True Negative Rate (TNR) of $90.89\\%$, significantly outperforming the CodeContests and CodeContests+ by margins of $4.32\\%$ and $9.37\\%$, respectively. Furthermore, fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-7B model on CodeContests-O results in a $9.52\\%$ improvement on LiveCodeBench (Pass@1). Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the quality of CodeContests-O.

To address this, linear attention mechanisms have been adopted to reduce computational cost; unfortunately, the resulting linear diffusion transformers (LiTs) models often come at the expense of generative performance, frequently producing over-smoothed attention weights that limit expressiveness. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Differential Linear Attention (DyDiLA), a novel linear attention formulation that enhances the effectiveness of LiTs by mitigating the oversmoothing issue and improving generation quality. Specifically, the novelty of DyDiLA lies in three key designs: (i) dynamic projection module, which facilitates the decoupling of token representations by learning with dynamically assigned knowledge; (ii) dynamic measure kernel, which provides a better similarity measurement to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between tokens by dynamically assigning kernel functions for token processing; and (iii) token differential operator, which enables more robust query-to-key retrieval by calculating the differences between the tokens and their corresponding information redundancy produced by dynamic measure kernel. To capitalize on DyDiLA, we introduce a refined LiT, termed DyDi-LiT, that systematically incorporates our advancements. Extensive experiments show that DyDi-LiT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple metrics, underscoring its strong practical potential."}

Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context. Our code will be open-source."}

We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance.

To address the limitations of existing approaches in handling dynamic demands and predicting users' implicit intents, in this paper we propose an edge service function chain (SFC) orchestration framework empowered by a Generative Intent Prediction Agent (GIPA). Our GIPA aims to shift the paradigm from passive execution to proactive prediction and orchestration. First, we construct a multidimensional intent space that includes functional preferences, QoS sensitivity, and resource requirements, enabling the mapping from unstructured natural language to quantifiable physical resource demands. Second, to cope with the complexity and randomness of intent sequences, we design an intent prediction model based on a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM), which reconstructs users' implicit intents from multidimensional context through a reverse denoising process. Finally, the predicted implicit intents are embedded as global prompts into the SFC orchestration model to guide the network in proactively and ahead-of-time optimizing SFC deployment strategies. Experiment results show that GIPA outperforms existing baseline methods in highly concurrent and highly dynamic scenarios."}

We investigate whether compact optical representations can serve as an efficient interface for executable semantic parsing. We present OptiSQL, a vision-driven framework that generates executable SQL directly from table images and natural language questions using compact optical tokens. OptiSQL leverages an OCR-oriented visual encoder to compress table structure and content into a small set of optical tokens and fine-tunes a pretrained decoder for SQL generation while freezing the encoder to isolate representation sufficiency. Experiments on a visualized version of Spider 2.0-Snow show that OptiSQL retains strong execution accuracy while reducing table input tokens by an order of magnitude.

However, user mobility creates highly dynamic service demands in edge networks, and existing service scheduling agents often lack generalization capabilities for new scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Intent-Driven General Agentic AI (IGAA) framework. Leveraging a meta-learning paradigm, IGAA enables AAI to continuously learn from prior service scheduling experiences to achieve generalized scheduling capabilities. Particularly, IGAA incorporates three core mechanisms. First, we design a Network-Service-Intent matrix mapping method to allow agents to simulate novel scenarios and generate training datasets. Second, we present an easy-to-hard generalization learning scheme with two customized algorithms, namely Resource Causal Effect-aware Transfer Learning (RCETL) and Action Potential Optimality-aware Transfer Learning (APOTL). These algorithms help IGAA adapt to new scenarios. Furthermore, to prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual IGAA learning, we propose a Generative Intent Replay (GIR) mechanism that synthesizes historical service data to consolidate prior capabilities. Finally, to mitigate the effect of LLM hallucinations on scenario simulation, we incorporate a scenario evaluation and correction model to guide agents in generating rational scenarios and datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate IGAA's strong generalization and scalability. Specifically, IGAA enables rapid adaptation by transferring learned policies to analogous new ones, such as applying latency-sensitive patterns from real-time computing to optimize novel Internet of Vehicles (IoV) services. Compared to scenario-specific methods, IGAA maintains the intent-satisfaction rate gap within 3.81%."}

This survey provides a unified perspective of visual puzzle reasoning in LVLMs. We frame visual puzzles through a common abstraction and organize existing benchmarks by the reasoning mechanisms they target (inductive, analogical, algorithmic, deductive, and geometric/spatial), thereby linking puzzle design to the cognitive operations required for solving. Synthesizing empirical evidence across these categories, we identify consistent limitations in current models, including brittle generalization, tight entanglement between perception and reasoning, and a persistent gap between fluent explanations and faithful execution. By framing visual puzzles as diagnostic instruments rather than task formats, this survey elaborates on the state of LVLM reasoning and outlines key directions for future benchmarks and reasoning-aware multimodal systems."}

Yet robot-oriented reconstruction faces a trilemma: sparse forward-facing views cause weak parallax and ill-posed geometry; dynamic occlusions and extreme lighting hinder stable texture fusion; and neural rendering typically needs expensive offline optimization, violating edge-side streaming constraints. We propose ParkingTwin, a training-free, lightweight system for online streaming 3D reconstruction. First, OSM-prior-driven geometric construction uses OpenStreetMap semantic topology to directly generate a metric-consistent TSDF, replacing blind geometric search with deterministic mapping and avoiding costly optimization. Second, geometry-aware dynamic filtering employs a quad-modal constraint field (normal/height/depth consistency) to reject moving vehicles and transient occlusions in real time. Third, illumination-robust fusion in CIELAB decouples luminance and chromaticity via adaptive L-channel weighting and depth-gradient suppression, reducing seams under abrupt lighting changes. ParkingTwin runs at 30+ FPS on an entry-level GTX 1660. On a 68,000 m^2 real-world dataset, it achieves SSIM 0.87 (+16.0%), delivers about 15x end-to-end speedup, and reduces GPU memory by 83.3% compared with state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that typically requires high-end GPUs (RTX 4090D).

We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method establishes a principled and efficient alternative, reducing latency by up to 2x compared to prior contrastive decoding methods that require multiple forward passes."}

Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research.

In cases where the Kolmogorov $N$-width decays fast enough, it is effective to approximate the solution as a sum of $N$ separable terms, each being the product of a parameter-dependent coefficient and a space-dependent function. This leads to reduced-order models with $N$ degrees of freedom and complexity of order ${\\mathcal O}(N^3)$.\n  However, when the $N$-width decays slowly, $N$ must be large to achieve acceptable accuracy, making cubic complexity prohibitive. The linear complexity measure in terms of Kolmogorov width must be replaced by the Gelfand width, with its associated sensing number. Recent nonlinear approaches based on this notion decompose the $N$ coordinates into two groups: $n$ free variables and $\\overline{n}$ dependent variables, where the latter are nonlinear functions of the former ($N= n+\\overline n$). Several works have focused on cases where these $\\overline{n}$ functions are homogeneous quadratic forms of the $n$ variables, with optimization strategies for choosing $n$ given a target accuracy.\n  A rigorous analysis of the local sensing number is carried out, showing that $n = p$ is optimal and appropriate, at least locally, around a reference point. In practical scenarios involving wide parameter ranges, the condition $p\\le n \\le p + k$ (with $k$ small) is valid and more robust from continuity arguments. Additionally, the assumption of a quadratic mapping, while justified in a local sense, becomes insufficient. More expressive nonlinear mappings-including those using machine learning-become necessary. This work contributes a theoretical foundation for such strategies and highlights the need for further investigations to push back the Kolmogorov Barrier."}

To solve this challenge, most recent studies have shown significant interest in Video Glass Surface Detection (VGSD). We observe that objects in the reflection (or transmission) layer appear farther from the glass surfaces. Consequently, in video motion scenarios, the notable reflected (or transmitted) objects on the glass surface move slower than objects in non-glass regions within the same spatial plane, and this motion inconsistency can effectively reveal the presence of glass surfaces. Based on this observation, we propose a novel network, named MVGD-Net, for detecting glass surfaces in videos by leveraging motion inconsistency cues. Our MVGD-Net features three novel modules: the Cross-scale Multimodal Fusion Module (CMFM) that integrates extracted spatial features and estimated optical flow maps, the History Guided Attention Module (HGAM) and Temporal Cross Attention Module (TCAM), both of which further enhances temporal features. A Temporal-Spatial Decoder (TSD) is also introduced to fuse the spatial and temporal features for generating the glass region mask.

Simulated Ignorance (SI), prompting models to suppress pre-cutoff knowledge, has emerged as a potential solution. We provide the first systematic test of whether SI can approximate True Ignorance (TI). Across 477 competition-level questions and 9 models, we find that SI fails systematically: (1) cutoff instructions leave a 52% performance gap between SI and TI; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning fails to suppress prior knowledge, even when reasoning traces contain no explicit post-cutoff references; (3) reasoning-optimized models exhibit worse SI fidelity despite superior reasoning trace quality. These findings demonstrate that prompts cannot reliably \"rewind\" model knowledge. We conclude that RF on pre-cutoff events is methodologically flawed; we recommend against using SI-based retrospective setups to benchmark forecasting capabilities."}

First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately. In fact, agents may overuse personal information, producing responses that feel forced, intrusive, or socially inappropriate to users. We refer to this issue as \\emph{over-personalization}. In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \\textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \\textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance. Our work takes an initial step toward more controllable and appropriate personalization in memory-augmented dialogue systems."}

We introduce MeshPhys, a lightweight spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that operates on the STGraph to estimate physiological signals.

Additionally, we demonstrate that ND-MT exhibits significant potential in addressing the multi-modality issue that has long challenged MT research and provides higher-quality candidates than Deterministic MT (D-MT) under temperature constraints.

We further investigate this emerging challenge by evaluating five state-of-the-art ND-MT systems across three open datasets using both lexical-based and semantic-based metrics at varying sampling sizes. The results reveal a Buckets effect across these systems: the lowest-quality candidate generated by ND-MT consistently determines the overall system ranking across different sampling sizes for all reasonable metrics.

Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a pillar symbolic computation method for reasoning with first-order logic formulas over reals with many applications in formal verification and automatic theorem proving. Variable orderings have a huge impact on its efficiency. Impeded by the difficulty to acquire abundant labelled data, existing learning-based approaches are only competitive with the best expert-based heuristics. In this work, we address this problem by designing a series of intimately connected tasks for which a large amount of annotated data can be easily obtained.

Experiments on publicly available CAD ordering datasets show that on average the orderings predicted by the new model are significantly better than those suggested by the best heuristic methods."}

In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches."}

To demonstrate the strength of the framework, we first introduce a Human Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) annotation protocol to improve the diagnostic capability of existing judge benchmarks by separating evaluation into explicit dimensions: content (C), voice quality (VQ), and paralinguistics (P). Using this data, TRACE constructs a textual blueprint of inexpensive audio signals and prompts an LLM to render dimension-wise judgments, fusing them into an overall rating via a deterministic policy. TRACE achieves higher agreement with human raters than ALMs and transcript-only LLM judges while being significantly more cost-effective. We will release the HCoT annotations and the TRACE framework to enable scalable and human-aligned S2S evaluation."}

By monitoring a given STL specification, we can detect the executions that violate it, which are often referred to as counterexamples. In practice, these counterexamples may arise from different causes and thus are relevant to different system defects. To effectively address this, we need a proper criterion for classifying these counterexamples, by which we can comprehend the possible violation patterns and the distributions of these counterexamples with respect to the patterns. In this paper, we propose a classification criterion by using parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to represent each class. Due to this formalism, identifying the classes of a counterexample requires finding proper parameter values of PSTL that enable a class to include the counterexample. To improve the efficiency of class identification, we further derive an inclusion relation between different classes, and then propose a binary search-like approach over it that significantly prunes the classes needed to query. We implement a prototype tool and experimentally evaluate its effectiveness on two widely-studied systems."}

Variational inference is introduced to model the uncertainty in attention weights, thereby enhancing robustness to noise. The design principles of the module are explained from the perspectives of the information bottleneck and regularization.

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior."}

Crucially, the analysis is applied specifically to high-beta altcoins (XRP, SOL, ADA), an asset class largely neglected by mainstream GARCH literature. Our results demonstrate that imposing stationarity (IGARCH + MR) drastically underestimates downside risk (5 percent value-at-risk reduced by 50%), while the asymmetric model (Model 3) leads to severe over-penalization. The EWMA/IGARCH baseline, characterized by infinite volatility persistence (alpha + beta = 1), provided the only robust conditional volatility estimate. This finding constitutes a formal rejection of the conventional financial hypotheses of volatility mean reversion and the asymmetric leverage effect in the altcoin asset class, establishing that non-stationary frameworks are a prerequisite for regulatory-grade risk modeling in this domain."}

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that SNR and its variants are not always highly correlated with human perception, prompting us to raise the questions: Why does SNR fail in measuring audio quality? And how to improve its reliability as an objective metric? In this paper, we identify the inadequate measurement of phase distance as a pivotal factor and propose to reformulate SNR with specially designed phase-distance terms, yielding an improved metric named GOMPSNR. We further extend the newly proposed formulation to derive two novel categories of loss function, corresponding to magnitude-guided phase refinement and joint magnitude-phase optimization, respectively. Besides, extensive experiments are conducted for an optimal combination of different loss functions. Experimental results on advanced neural vocoders demonstrate that our proposed GOMPSNR exhibits more reliable error measurement than SNR.

The framework operates through three phases: (1) statistical analysis identifies key behavioral features, (2) natural language encoding transforms structured data into contextual descriptions, and (3) LLM adaptation predicts travel mode through multiple learning paradigms including zero-shot and one/few-shot learning and domain-enhanced prompting. We evaluate TransMode-LLM using both general-purpose models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) and reasoning-focused models (o3-mini, o4-mini) with varying sample sizes on real-world travel survey data. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the LLM-based approach achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baseline classifiers models. Moreover, few-shot learning significantly improves prediction accuracy, with models like o3-mini showing consistent improvements of up to 42.9\\% with 5 provided examples. However, domain-enhanced prompting shows divergent effects across LLM architectures. In detail, it is helpful to improve performance for general-purpose models with GPT-4o achieving improvements of 2.27% to 12.50%. However, for reasoning-oriented models (o3-mini, o4-mini), domain knowledge enhancement does not universally improve performance. This study advances the application of LLMs in travel behavior modeling, providing promising and valuable insights for both academic research and transportation policy-making in the future."}

However, designing interoperable control schemes that jointly exploit long-term traffic awareness and near-real-time radio resource optimization remains a challenging problem, particularly under dense multi-cell interference and heterogeneous service demands. This paper proposes an interoperable rApp/xApp-driven dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) framework for O-RAN, based on a graph-theoretic formulation of physical resource block (PRB) assignment. The proposed architecture leverages a non-real-time radio intelligent controller (Non-RT RIC) rApp to predict aggregated traffic evolution and generate high-level spectrum policies at the minutes timescale, while a near-real-time RIC (Near-RT RIC) xApp constructs a user-centric conflict graph and performs fairness-aware PRB allocation at sub-second timescales. To mitigate persistent user starvation, a conflict-aware modified proportional fair (MPF) scheduling mechanism is applied, enabling controlled interference-free PRB time-sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the PRB assignment success rate (above 90%) and service-share fairness (above 85%) across different channel configurations and user demands, while maintaining architectural separation and rApp/xApp interoperability in accordance with O-RAN principles."}

Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models. In this latent space, we train a Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, enabling efficient and expressive graph generation. Our approach achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art graph diffusion models, while achieving up to $1000\\times$ speed-up."}

Rectangular floorplans arise naturally in a variety of applications, including VLSI design, architectural layout, and cartography, where efficient and flexible spatial subdivisions are required. A central concept in this domain is that of area-universality: a floorplan (or more generally, a rectangular layout) is area-universal if, for any assignment of target areas to its constituent rectangles, there exists a combinatorially equivalent layout that realizes these areas.\n  In this paper, we investigate the structural conditions under which an outerplanar graph admits an area-universal rectangular layout. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for area-universality in this setting, thereby providing a complete characterization of admissible outerplanar graphs.

However, the performance of Starlink networks in mobility settings, particularly with frequent changes in the UT's orientation, and the impact of environmental factors, such as transient obstructions, has not been thoroughly studied, leaving gaps in understanding the causes of performance degradation. Recently, researchers have started identifying the communicating satellites to evaluate satellite selection strategies and the impact on network performance. However, existing Starlink satellite identification methods only work in stationary, obstruction-free scenarios, as they do not account for UT mobility, obstructions or detect dynamic beam switching events. In this paper, we reveal that the UT can perform multiple dynamic beam switching attempts to connect to different satellites when the UT-satellite link is degraded. This degradation can occur either due to the loss of line-of-sight (LoS) from changes in the FOV or obstructions, or due to poor signal quality, extending UT-satellite handovers beyond the well-known 15-second regular handover interval. We propose a mobility-aware Starlink satellite identification method that detects dynamic beam switching events, and plausibly explain network performance using UT's diagnostic data and connected satellite information. Our findings demystifies the mobile Starlink network performance degradations, which is crucial to enhance the end-to-end performance of transport layer protocols and in diverse application scenarios."}

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable. We validate our approach using real-world driving datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by effectively integrating road characteristics, real-time traffic conditions, and historical speed patterns in a task-aware manner."}

To efficiently analyze a large set of ships, a raster approach to querying the AIS data is proposed. A spatially partitioned data warehouse with a granularized cell representation and heatmap presentation is designed, developed, and evaluated. Currently the data warehouse stores ~312 million kilometers of ship trajectories and more than +8 billion rows in the largest table. It is found that searching the cell representation is faster than searching the trajectory representation. Further, we show that the spatially divided shards enable a consistently good scale-up for both cell and heatmap analytics in large areas, ranging between 354% to 1164% with a 5x increase in workers"}

We focus on partition functions defined for CSPs by introducing external fields to the variables. A key component in our approach is a projection-lifting scheme, which enables us to essentially lift information percolation type analysis for Markov chains from the real line to the complex plane.

State-of-the-art predictors generally perform very well but occasionally suffer from high Misprediction Per Kilo Instruction due to hard-to-predict branches. In this work, we investigate if predicting branches using microarchitectural information, in addition to traditional branch history, can improve prediction accuracy. Our approach considers branch timing information (resolution cycle) both for older branches in the Reorder Buffer (ROB) and recently committed, and for younger branches relative to the branch we re-predict. We propose Speculative Branch Resolution (SBR) in which, N cycles after a branch allocates in the ROB, various timing information is collected and used to re-predict. Using the gem5 simulator we implement and perform a limit-study of SBR using a TAGE-Like predictor. Our experiments show that the post-alloc timing information we used was not able to yield performance gains over an unbounded TAGE-SC. However, we find two hard to predict branches where timing information did provide an advantage and thoroughly analysed one of them to understand why. This finding suggests that predictors may benefit from specific microarchitectural information to increase accuracy on specific hard to predict branches and that overriding predictions in the backend may yet yield performance benefits, but that further research is needed to determine such information vectors."}

The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera.

To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover.

It represents the first educational platform that assists learners holistically across both frontend and backend design. The proposed approach integrates an LLM-based chat agent into a browser-based workflow built upon the Tiny Tapeout ecosystem. The workflow guides users from an initial design idea through RTL code generation to a tapeout-ready chip. To evaluate the concept, a case study was conducted with 18 high-school students. Within a 90-minute session they developed eight functional VGA chip designs in a 130 nm technology. Despite having no prior experience in chip design, all groups successfully implemented tapeout-ready projects. The results demonstrate the feasibility and educational impact of LLM-assisted chip design, highlighting its potential to attract and inspire early learners and significantly broaden the target audience for the field."}

To ensure stable training, we introduce three alternative losses that enable end-to-end optimization of both the discriminative colorspace and segmentation process.

In a seminal paper, Karloff and Shmoys [KS87] devised a parallel algorithm with time $O\\left(Δ^5\\cdot\\log n\\cdot\\left(\\log^3 n+Δ^2\\right)\\right)$ and $O(m\\cdotΔ)$ processors.

The resulting block system is composed entirely of second-kind operators. A Petrov-Galerkin (mixed) discretization using Rao-Wilton-Glisson trial functions and Buffa-Christiansen test functions is employed, yielding linear systems that remain well conditioned on dense meshes and at low frequencies without the need for additional stabilization.

To address these, we propose ELSA (Efficient LLM-centric Split Aggregation), a novel framework that systematically integrates split learning (SL) and hierarchical federated learning (HFL) for distributed LLM fine-tuning over resource-constrained edge networks. ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges. Experiments across diverse NLP tasks demonstrate that ELSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, convergence behavior, and robustness, establishing a scalable and privacy-aware solution for edge-side LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints."}

Given high model training costs and user experience requirements, balancing model privacy and low runtime overhead is critical. TEEs offer a viable defense, and prior work has proposed heterogeneous GPU-TEE inference frameworks via parameter obfuscation to balance efficiency and confidentiality. However, recent studies find partial obfuscation defenses ineffective, while robust schemes cause unacceptable latency. To resolve these issues, we propose ConvShatter, a novel obfuscation scheme that achieves low latency and high accuracy while preserving model confidentiality and integrity. It leverages convolution linearity to decompose kernels into critical and common ones, inject confounding decoys, and permute channel/kernel orders. Pre-deployment, it performs kernel decomposition, decoy injection and order obfuscation, storing minimal recovery parameters securely in the TEE. During inference, the TEE reconstructs outputs of obfuscated convolutional layers. Extensive experiments show ConvShatter substantially reduces latency overhead with strong security guarantees; versus comparable schemes, it cuts overhead by 16% relative to GroupCover while maintaining accuracy on par with the original model."}

Self-supervised speech representations (S3Rs) have driven many advances, but it remains unclear whether S3R-based turn-taking models rely on prosodic cues, lexical cues or both. We introduce a vocoder-based approach to control prosody and lexical cues in speech more cleanly than prior work. This allows us to probe the voice-activity projection model, an S3R-based turn-taking model. We find that prediction on prosody-matched, unintelligible noise is similar to accuracy on clean speech. This reveals both prosodic and lexical cues support turn-taking, but either can be used in isolation. Hence, future models may only require prosody, providing privacy and potential performance benefits. When either prosodic or lexical information is disrupted, the model exploits the other without further training, indicating they are encoded in S3Rs with limited interdependence. Results are consistent in CPC-based and wav2vec2.0 S3Rs. We discuss our findings and highlight a number of directions for future work. All code is available to support future research."}

To overcome these efficiency drawbacks, we propose \\OURS, a feed-forward method to generate high-quality Gaussian head avatars from only a few input images while supporting real-time animation. Our approach directly learns a per-pixel Gaussian representation from the input images, and aggregates multi-view information using a transformer-based encoder that fuses image features from both DINOv3 and Stable Diffusion VAE. For real-time animation, we extend the explicit Gaussian representations with per-Gaussian features and introduce a lightweight MLP-based dynamic network to predict 3D Gaussian deformations from expression codes. Furthermore, to enhance geometric smoothness of the 3D head, we employ point maps from a pre-trained large reconstruction model as geometry supervision. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both rendering quality and inference efficiency, while supporting real-time dynamic avatar animation."}

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel RRWEI framework that couples dual most significant bit-plane (dual-MSBs) embedding with spatial redundancy and error-correcting coding. By compressing prediction-error bit-planes, sufficient embedding space and auxiliary information for lossless reconstruction are reserved. The dual-MSBs are further reorganized using a spiral embedding strategy to distribute multiple redundant watermark copies across spatially dispersed regions, enhancing robustness against both noise and spatial loss.Experimental results on standard test images demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms under evaluated settings robustness against Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, and diverse cropping attacks, while maintaining perfect reversibility and high embedding capacity.

The game is played on a graph having a subset of vertices labeled as exits and the goal of one of the two players, called the fugitive, is to reach one of these exit vertices. The second player, i.e. the fugitive adversary, is called the Nemesis. Her goal is to trap the fugitive in a connected component which does not contain any exit. At each round of the game, the fugitive moves from one vertex to an adjacent vertex. Then the Nemesis deletes one edge anywhere in the graph. The game ends when either the fugitive reached an exit or when he is in a connected component that does not contain any exit. In trees and graphs of maximum degree bounded by 3, Nemesis can be solved in linear time. We also show that a variant of the game called Blizzard where only edges adjacent to the position of the fugitive can be deleted also admits a linear time solution. For arbitrary graphs, we show that Nemesis is PSPACE-complete, and that it is NP-hard on planar multigraphs. We extend our results to the related Cat Herding problem, proving its PSPACE-completeness. We also prove that finding a strategy based on a full binary escape tree whose leaves are exists is NP-complete."}

Furthermore, we prove that the optimal fixed regularization strength scales nearly linearly with the number of tasks $T$, specifically as $T/\\ln T$. To our knowledge, this is the first such result in theoretical continual learning. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments on linear regression and neural networks, illustrating how this scaling law affects generalization and offering a practical recipe for the design of continual learning systems."}

In this paper, we present OCCAM, the first training-free approach to CAC that operates without the need of any supplementary information. Moreover, our approach addresses the multi-class variant of the problem, as it is capable of counting the object instances in each and every class among arbitrary object classes within an image. We leverage Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a foundation model, and a custom threshold-based variant of the First Integer Neighbor Clustering Hierarchy (FINCH) algorithm to achieve competitive performance on widely used benchmark datasets, FSC-147 and CARPK. We propose a synthetic multi-class dataset and F1 score as a more suitable evaluation metric. The code for our method and the proposed synthetic dataset will be made publicly available at https://mikespanak.github.io/OCCAM_counter."}

We have analysed RaaS samples by network forensic approach to investigate on packet captures of benign and malicious network traffic. The behavior analysis of RaaS family Ransomwares, Ryuk and Gandcrab have been investigated to classify the packets as suspicious, malicious, and non-malicious which further aid in generating RaaS packet signatures for early detection and mitigation of ransomwares belonging to RaaS family. More than 40\\% of packets are found malicious in this experiment. The proposed method is also verified by Virus Total API Approach.

To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors.

We introduce MTV, a multi-task visual pretraining framework that jointly optimizes a shared backbone across vision-language contrastive, self-supervised, and dense spatial objectives.

HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback.

Conventional strategies rank high in benchmarks due to their intrinsic capabilities to handle numerical inputs and careful modelling choices that balance exploration and Pareto-front exploitation, as well as handle multiple (conflicting) objectives. In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance. Empirically, it consistently outperforms the global LLM-based multi-objective optimizer and is on par with standard evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks."}

In practice, they often grow to substantial size and complexity, undergoing thousands of modifications over time due to evolution, refactoring, and maintenance. The rise of AI has sparked interest in how software modeling activities can be automated. Recently, LLM-based approaches for software model completion have been proposed, however, the state of the art supports only single-location model completion by predicting changes at a specific location. Going beyond, we aim to bridge the gap toward handling coordinated changes that span multiple locations across large, complex models. Specifically, we propose a novel global embedding-based next focus predictor, NextFocus, which is capable of multi-location model completion for the first time. The predictor consists of a neural network with an attention mechanism that is trained on historical software model evolution data. Starting from an existing change, it predicts further model elements to change, potentially spanning multiple parts of the model. We evaluate our approach on multi-location model changes that have actually been performed by developers in real-world projects. NextFocus achieves promising results for multi-location model completion, even when changes are heavily spread across the model. It achieves an average Precision@k score of 0.98 for $k \\leq 10$, significantly outperforming the three baseline approaches."}

It monitors the evolution of land cover over time. Based on this, Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) introduces a new requirement. It aims to reduce the reliance on predefined categories. Existing training-free OVCD methods mostly use CLIP to identify categories. These methods also need extra models like DINO to extract features. However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks. Experiments on four public benchmarks (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, S2Looking, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 67.2, 66.5, 24.5, and 27.1 (class-average), respectively, surpassing all previous methods."}

This paper presents an architecture that extends the European Union eIDAS trust framework into public blockchain ecosystems by cryptographically binding smart contracts to qualified electronic seals issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers. The mechanism establishes a verifiable chain of trust from the European Commission List of Trusted Lists to individual on-chain addresses, enabling machine-verifiable proofs for automated regulatory validation, such as Know Your Contract, Counterparty, and Business checks, without introducing new trusted intermediaries. Regulatory requirements arising from eIDAS, MiCA, PSD2, PSR, and the proposed European Business Wallet are analyzed, and a cryptographic suite meeting both eIDAS implementing regulations and EVM execution constraints following the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is identified, namely ECDSA with P-256 and CAdES formatting. Two complementary trust validation models are presented: an off-chain workflow for agent-to-agent payment protocols and a fully on-chain workflow enabling regulatory-compliant DeFi operations between legal entities. The on-chain model converts regulatory compliance from a per-counterparty administrative burden into an automated, standardized process, enabling mutual validation at first interaction without prior business relationships.

To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study. Results show that PREFAB outperforms baselines in modeling affective inflections while mitigating workload (and conditionally mitigating temporal burden).

In this work, we consider the monocular setting, i.e. single-view input, for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). Here, the task is to predict a 3D point set of human skeletal joints from a single 2D input image. While by definition this is an ill-posed problem, recent work has presented methods that solve it with up to several-centimetre error. Typically, these methods employ a two-step approach, where the first step is to detect the 2D skeletal joints in the input image, followed by the step of 2D-to-3D lifting. We find that common lifting models fail when encountering a rotated input. We argue that learning a single human pose along with its in-plane rotations is considerably easier and more geometrically grounded than directly learning a point-to-point mapping. Furthermore, our intuition is that endowing the model with the notion of rotation equivariance without explicitly constraining its parameter space should lead to a more straightforward learning process than one with equivariance by design. Utilising the common HPE benchmarks, we confirm that the 2D rotation equivariance per se improves the model performance on human poses akin to rotations in the image plane, and can be efficiently and straightforwardly learned by augmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art equivariant-by-design methods."}

However, their application to autonomous Electronic Health Records~(EHRs) navigation remains constrained by a reliance on curated inputs and simplified retrieval tasks. To bridge the gap between idealized experimental settings and realistic clinical environments, we present AgentEHR. This benchmark challenges agents to execute complex decision-making tasks, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, requiring long-range interactive reasoning directly within raw and high-noise databases. In tackling these tasks, we identify that existing summarization methods inevitably suffer from critical information loss and fractured reasoning continuity. To address this, we propose RetroSum, a novel framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. By dynamically re-evaluating interaction history, the retrospective mechanism prevents long-context information loss and ensures unbroken logical coherence. Additionally, the evolving strategy bridges the domain gap by retrieving accumulated experience from a memory bank. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RetroSum achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% over competitive baselines, while significantly decreasing total interaction errors by up to 92.3%."}

Although recent methods have advanced medical report generation (MRG) and visual question answering (VQA) with medical vision-language models (VLMs), these methods, however, predominantly operate under a sample-isolated inference paradigm, as such processing cases independently without access to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) or structurally related patient examples. This paradigm limits reasoning to image-derived information alone, which ignores external complementary medical evidence for potentially more accurate diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we propose \\textbf{HyperWalker}, a \\textit{Deep Diagnosis} framework that reformulates clinical reasoning via dynamic hypergraphs and test-time training. First, we construct a dynamic hypergraph, termed \\textbf{iBrochure}, to model the structural heterogeneity of EHR data and implicit high-order associations among multimodal clinical information. Within this hypergraph, a reinforcement learning agent, \\textbf{Walker}, navigates to and identifies optimal diagnostic paths. To ensure comprehensive coverage of diverse clinical characteristics in test samples, we incorporate a \\textit{linger mechanism}, a multi-hop orthogonal retrieval strategy that iteratively selects clinically complementary neighborhood cases reflecting distinct clinical attributes. Experiments on MRG with MIMIC and medical VQA on EHRXQA demonstrate that HyperWalker achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/Bean-Young/HyperWalker"}

To this end, we propose a multi-agent prompt optimization framework in which language-model agents jointly propose feature definitions, extract feature values, and evaluate feature quality using dataset-level performance and interpretability feedback. Instruction prompts are iteratively refined based on this structured feedback, enabling optimization over prompts that induce shared feature sets rather than per-example predictions. This formulation departs from prior prompt optimization methods that rely on per-sample supervision and provides a principled mechanism for automatic feature discovery from unstructured text."}

In this work, we investigate and mitigate this limitation by training CLAP models from scratch on the Million Song Dataset with LP-MusicCaps-MSD captions. We introduce negation through text augmentation and a dissimilarity-based contrastive loss, designed to explicitly separate original and negated captions in the joint embedding space.

VulnResolver unites the adaptability of autonomous agents with the stability of workflow-guided repair through two specialized agents. The Context Pre-Collection Agent (CPCAgent) adaptively explores the repository to gather dependency and contextual information, while the Safety Property Analysis Agent (SPAAgent) generates and validates the safety properties violated by vulnerabilities. Together, these agents produce structured analyses that enrich the original issue reports, enabling more accurate vulnerability localization and patch generation.\n  Evaluations on the SEC-bench benchmark show that VulnResolver resolves 75% of issues on SEC-bench Lite, achieving the best resolution performance. On SEC-bench Full, VulnResolver also significantly outperforms the strongest baseline, the agent-based OpenHands, confirming its effectiveness. Overall, VulnResolver delivers an adaptive and security-aware framework that advances end-to-end automated vulnerability issue resolution through workflow stability and the specialized agents' capabilities in contextual reasoning and property-based analysis."}

The interview-based method captures a project's governance structure, its theory of change, AI model and data characteristics, and social, environmental, and economic impacts.

To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval.

ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training.

Current theories--trust calibration, cognitive load, and self-determination--cannot fully account for this paradox.\n  Method: The framework models autonomy as a continuous stochastic process influenced by information-induced cognitive load. Using stochastic control theory, autonomy evolution is formalized as geometric Brownian motion with information-dependent drift, and optimal transparency is derived via Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Monte Carlo simulations validate theoretical predictions.\n  Results: Mathematical analysis generates five testable predictions about disengagement timing, working memory moderation, autonomy trajectory shapes, and optimal information levels. Computational solutions demonstrate that dynamic transparency policies outperform both maximum and minimum transparency by adapting to real-time cognitive state. The optimal policy exhibits threshold structure: provide information when autonomy is high and accumulated load is low; withhold when resources are depleted.\n  Conclusion: Transparency effects depend on dynamic cognitive resource depletion rather than static design choices. Information provision triggers metacognitive processing that reduces perceived control when cognitive load exceeds working memory capacity.\n  Application: The framework provides design principles for adaptive AI systems: adjust transparency based on real-time cognitive state, implement information budgets respecting capacity limits, and personalize thresholds based on individual working memory capacity."}

Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content.\n  We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality.\n  Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding.\n  We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets."}

We address this challenge by developing a Unified Information Pipeline that standardises heterogeneous datasets into a comparable information flow and evaluates a fixed, deployment-relevant detector under controlled cross-domain protocols. Across multiple domains, we find that structural factors, such as scene composition, object density, and contextual redundancy, explain cross-domain performance loss more strongly than visual degradation such as turbidity, with sparse scenes inducing a characteristic \"Context Collapse\" failure mode. We further validate operational feasibility by benchmarking inference on low-cost edge hardware, showing that runtime optimisation enables practical sampling rates for remote monitoring.

Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations. Extensive experiments on LH-VLN show that our approach achieves reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation, improving success rates and efficiency while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT methods."}

Unlike existing methods relying predominantly on vision, whose performance degrades under varying illumination, background clutter, or partial visibility, the proposed approach integrates foundation-model-based visual perception with adaptive tactile exploration. The visual pipeline exploits SAM for instance segmentation and Florence for semantic refinement, followed by skeletonization, endpoint detection, and point-cloud extraction. Occluded cable segments are autonomously identified and explored with a tactile sensor, which provides local point clouds that are merged with the visual data through Euclidean clustering and topology-preserving fusion. A B-spline interpolation driven by endpoint-guided point sorting yields a smooth and complete reconstruction of the cable shape. Experimental validation using a robotic manipulator equipped with an RGB-D camera and a tactile pad demonstrates that the proposed framework accurately reconstructs both simple and highly curved single or multiple cable configurations, even when large portions are occluded. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model-enhanced cross-modal perception for advancing robotic manipulation of deformable objects."}

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing."}

The occupation measure associates program states with their expected number of visits, given the initial distribution. Based on this, we derive the notion of an occupation invariant. Such invariants are essentially dual to probabilistic martingales, the predominant technique for formal probabilistic loop analysis in the literature. A key feature of occupation invariants is that they can take the initial distribution into account and often yield a proof of positive almost sure termination as a by-product.\n  Finally, we present an automatic, template-based invariant synthesis approach for occupation invariants by encoding them as generating functions.

While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric: (1) Graph-based Consensus to filter misleading rationales by identifying mainstream reasoning paths; (2) Mutual-Information-based Adaptability to detect \"epiphany moments\" for genuinely understanding the reasoning process rather than merely imitating; and (3) Loss-based Difficulty to assess student receptivity to the teacher's guidance and prevent negative transfer. Extensive experiments and latent space analysis demonstrate that COMPACT effectively integrates diverse reasoning capabilities without damaging the model's original knowledge structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

To address this challenge, we propose Tree-aware Aligned Global Sampling (TAGS), a unified framework that leverages a knowledge tree built from fine-grained tags, thereby enabling joint control of global quality, diversity, and target alignment. Using an LLM-based tagger, we extract atomic knowledge concepts, which are organized into a global tree through bottom-up hierarchical clustering. By grounding data instances onto this tree, a tree-aware metric then quantifies data quality and diversity, facilitating effective sampling. Our controllable sampling strategy maximizes tree-level information gain and enforces leaf-level alignment via KL-divergence for specific domains.

Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations.

Using human values as a testbed - given their semantic richness and centrality to alignment - we employ probing (detecting value traces in internal activations) and steering (modifying representations to shift behavior). Across six open-source LLMs and ten value dimensions, probing shows that diagnostic probes trained solely on abstract value descriptions reliably detect the same values in concrete event narratives and decision reasoning, demonstrating cross-level transfer. Steering reveals an asymmetry: intervening on value representations causally shifts concrete judgments and decisions (A-C, C-C), yet leaves abstract interpretations unchanged (A-A), suggesting that encoded abstract values function as stable anchors rather than malleable activations.

As a result, processes launched remotely, locally, or by background services are often treated equivalently once privileges are obtained, complicating security reasoning and enabling post-compromise abuse of sensitive system interfaces. We introduce origin-aware mandatory access control (OAMAC), a kernel-level enforcement model that treats execution origin -- such as physical user presence, remote access, or service execution -- as a first-class security attribute. OAMAC mediates access to security-critical subsystems based on execution provenance rather than identity alone, enabling centralized governance over multiple attack surfaces while significantly reducing policy complexity. We present a deployable prototype implemented entirely using the Linux eBPF LSM framework, requiring no kernel modifications. OAMAC classifies execution origin using kernel-visible metadata, propagates origin across process creation, and enforces origin-aware policies on both sensitive filesystem interfaces and the kernel BPF control plane. Policies are maintained in kernel-resident eBPF maps and can be reconfigured at runtime via a minimal userspace tool. Our evaluation demonstrates that OAMAC effectively restricts common post-compromise actions available to remote attackers while preserving normal local administration and system stability. We argue that execution origin represents a missing abstraction in contemporary operating system security models, and that elevating it to a first-class concept enables practical attack surface reduction without requiring subsystem-specific expertise or heavyweight security frameworks."}

This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for like-for-like operational assessment of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) under identical, real-world driving conditions. The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system.

Their impressive generative capability allows them to approximate sampling from a prior distribution, which alongside a known likelihood function permits posterior sampling without retraining the model. While recent methods have made strides in advancing the accuracy of posterior sampling, the majority focuses on single-image inverse problems. However, for modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is common to acquire multiple complementary measurements, each low-resolution along a different axis. In this work, we generalize common diffusion-based inverse single-image problem solvers for multi-image super-resolution (MISR) MRI. We show that the DPS likelihood correction allows an exactly-separable gradient decomposition across independently acquired measurements, enabling MISR without constructing a joint operator, modifying the diffusion model, or increasing network function evaluations. We derive MISR versions of DPS, DMAP, DPPS, and diffusion-based PnP/ADMM, and demonstrate substantial gains over SISR across $4\\times/8\\times/16\\times$ anisotropic degradations. Our results achieve state-of-the-art super-resolution of anisotropic MRI volumes and, critically, enable reconstruction of near-isotropic anatomy from routine 2D multi-slice acquisitions, which are otherwise highly degraded in orthogonal views."}

Due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality human preference annotations, distilling preferences from generative LLMs has emerged as a standard practice. However, existing approaches predominantly treat teacher models as simple binary annotators, failing to fully exploit the rich knowledge and capabilities for RM distillation. To address this, we propose RM-Distiller, a framework designed to systematically exploit the multifaceted capabilities of teacher LLMs: (1) Refinement capability, which synthesizes highly correlated response pairs to create fine-grained and contrastive signals. (2) Scoring capability, which guides the RM in capturing precise preference strength via a margin-aware optimization objective. (3) Generation capability, which incorporates the teacher's generative distribution to regularize the RM to preserve its fundamental linguistic knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RM-Distiller significantly outperforms traditional distillation methods both on RM benchmarks and reinforcement learning-based alignment, proving that exploiting multifaceted teacher capabilities is critical for effective reward modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic research on RM distillation from generative LLMs."}

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

In this work, we propose a remarkably simple reward model, HuDA, to quantify and improve the human motion in generated videos. HuDA integrates human detection confidence for appearance quality, and a temporal prompt alignment score to capture motion realism. We show this simple reward function that leverages off-the-shelf models without any additional training, outperforms specialized models finetuned with manually annotated data. Using HuDA for Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training of video models, we significantly enhance video generation, especially when generating complex human motions, outperforming state-of-the-art models like Wan 2.1, with win-rate of 73%. Finally, we demonstrate that HuDA improves generation quality beyond just humans, for instance, significantly improving generation of animal videos and human-object interactions."}

These vehicles are typically equipped with active sensors, such as LiDAR, which scan the environment in predefined patterns. 3D box annotation based on data from such sensors is challenging in dynamic scenarios, where objects are observed at different timestamps, hence different positions. Without proper handling of this phenomenon, systematic errors are prone to being introduced in the box annotations. Our work is the first to discover such annotation errors in widely used, publicly available datasets. Through our novel offline estimation method, we correct the annotations so that they follow physically feasible trajectories and achieve spatial and temporal consistency with the sensor data. For the first time, we define metrics for this problem; and we evaluate our method on the Argoverse 2, MAN TruckScenes, and our proprietary datasets. Our approach increases the quality of box annotations by more than 17% in these datasets. Furthermore, we quantify the annotation errors in them and find that the original annotations are misplaced by up to 2.5 m, with highly dynamic objects being the most affected. Finally, we test the impact of the errors in benchmarking and find that the impact is larger than the improvements that state-of-the-art methods typically achieve with respect to the previous state-of-the-art methods; showing that accurate annotations are essential for correct interpretation of performance.

Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels. This work establishes that enabling models to selectively ignore corrupted samples is a powerful and generalizable strategy for building more reliable segmentation models.

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a transformative alternative, conceptualizing text generation as a holistic, bidirectional denoising process akin to a sculptor refining a masterpiece. However, the potential of DLMs remains largely untapped as they are frequently confined within AR-legacy infrastructures and optimization frameworks. In this Perspective, we identify ten fundamental challenges ranging from architectural inertia and gradient sparsity to the limitations of linear reasoning that prevent DLMs from reaching their ``GPT-4 moment''. We propose a strategic roadmap organized into four pillars: foundational infrastructure, algorithmic optimization, cognitive reasoning, and unified multimodal intelligence. By shifting toward a diffusion-native ecosystem characterized by multi-scale tokenization, active remasking, and latent thinking, we can move beyond the constraints of the causal horizon. We argue that this transition is essential for developing next-generation AI capable of complex structural reasoning, dynamic self-correction, and seamless multimodal integration."}

In this paper, we rethink the role of the client side and propose Federated Balanced Learning, i.e., FBL, to prevent this issue from the beginning through sample balance on the client side. Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients. Furthermore, we design a Knowledge Alignment Strategy to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, and a Knowledge Drop Strategy to regularize our method.

Layerwise interventions further show that early and late MoE layers support language-specific processing, whereas middle layers serve as language-agnostic capacity hubs.

To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation. To preserve object identity and consistency across edits, we condition the diffusion process on reference images using IP-Adapter, enabling coherent object appearance throughout interactive 3D editing while maintaining global scene coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that POCI-Diff produces high-quality images consistent with the specified 3D layouts and edits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and layout adherence while eliminating warping-induced geometric artifacts."}

They primarily rely on either transforming the multimodal query into a single text using image-to-text models or employing large language models for target image description generation, approaches that often fail to capture complementary visual information and complete semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval method with Complementary Visual-Semantic Integration (CVSI).

(2) Semantic Information Extraction, which involves using a pre-trained captioning model to generate multiple captions for the reference image, followed by leveraging an LLM to generate the modified captions and the objects most likely to be added. (3) Complementary Information Retrieval, which integrates information extracted from both the query and database images to retrieve the target image, enabling the system to efficiently handle retrieval queries in a variety of situations.

We then progressively build a series of deep clusters from the extracted features.

To date, the most advanced test generators rely on generative AI to synthesize inputs; however, these approaches remain limited in providing semantic insight into the causes of misbehaviours and in offering fine-grained semantic controllability over the generated inputs. In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output. Through this process, it identifies which features lead to behavior shifts and uses a vision-language model for semantic attribution. By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness. Empirical results across image classification and detection tasks show that Detect generates high-quality test cases with fine-grained control, reveals distinct shortcut behaviors across model architectures (convolutional and transformer-based), and bugs that are not captured by accuracy metrics. Specifically, Detect outperforms a state-of-the-art test generator in decision boundary discovery and a leading spurious feature localization method in identifying robustness failures. Our findings show that fully fine-tuned convolutional models are prone to overfitting on localized cues, such as co-occurring visual traits, while weakly supervised transformers tend to rely on global features, such as environmental variances. These findings highlight the value of interpretable and feature-aware testing in improving DL model reliability."}

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales."}

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TDPCM."}

Most existing datasets are captured from ground-level perspectives, and models trained on them often struggle to transfer to drastically different domains such as aerial views. This paper examines how curriculum-based training strategies can improve generalization to unseen real aerial-view data without using any real aerial data during training.\n  We explore curriculum learning for cross-view action recognition using two out-of-domain sources: synthetic aerial-view data and real ground-view data. Our results on the evaluation on order of training (fine-tuning on synthetic aerial data vs. real ground data) shows that fine-tuning on real ground data but differ in how they transition from synthetic to real. The first uses a two-stage curriculum with direct fine-tuning, while the second applies a progressive curriculum that expands the dataset in multiple stages before fine-tuning. We evaluate both methods on the REMAG dataset using SlowFast (CNN-based) and MViTv2 (Transformer-based) architectures.\n  Results show that combining the two out-of-domain datasets clearly outperforms training on a single domain, whether real ground-view or synthetic aerial-view. Both curriculum strategies match the top-1 accuracy of simple dataset combination while offering efficiency gains. With the two-step fine-tuning method, SlowFast achieves up to a 37% reduction in iterations and MViTv2 up to a 30% reduction compared to simple combination.

This ability is crucial not only for advancing 3D generation research but also for practical applications in animation, editing, and digital content creation. Existing approaches either operate directly on geometry, limiting them to shape-only morphing while neglecting textures, or extend 2D interpolation strategies into 3D, which often causes semantic ambiguity, structural misalignment, and texture blurring. These challenges underscore the necessity to jointly preserve geometric consistency, texture alignment, and robustness throughout the transition process. To address this, we propose Interp3D, a novel training-free framework for textured 3D morphing. It harnesses generative priors and adopts a progressive alignment principle to ensure both geometric fidelity and texture coherence. Starting from semantically aligned interpolation in condition space, Interp3D enforces structural consistency via SLAT (Structured Latent)-guided structure interpolation, and finally transfers appearance details through fine-grained texture fusion. For comprehensive evaluations, we construct a dedicated dataset, Interp3DData, with graded difficulty levels and assess generation results from fidelity, transition smoothness, and plausibility. Both quantitative metrics and human studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed approach over previous methods. Source code is available at https://github.com/xiaolul2/Interp3D."}

We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations. We treat the robot control stack as a black-box system. We further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states.

However, due to the fact that existing tools typically rely on agents installed on target systems, they leave suspicious traces that make it easy to distinguish their activities from those of real human attackers. Moreover, these tools often lack relevant capabilities, such as handling of interactive prompts, and are unsuitable for emulating specific stages of the kill chain, such as initial access. This paper thus introduces AttackMate, an open-source attack scripting language and execution engine designed to mimic behavior patterns of actual attackers. We validate the tool in a case study covering common attack steps including privilege escalation, information gathering, and lateral movement. Our results indicate that log artifacts resulting from AttackMate's activities resemble those produced by human attackers more closely than those generated by standard adversary emulation tools."}

TLSQL is implemented as a lightweight Python library that translates these specifications into standard SQL queries and structured learning task descriptions. The generated SQL queries are executed natively by the database engine, while the task descriptions are consumed by downstream table learning frameworks.

PMCE constructs a nonparametric knowledge bank that stores visual statistics for each category as well as CLIP-encoded class name embeddings of the base classes. At meta-test time, the most relevant base classes are retrieved based on the similarities of class name embeddings for each novel category. These statistics are then aggregated into category-specific prior information and fused with the support set prototypes via a simple MAP update. Simultaneously, a frozen BLIP captioner provides label-free instance-level image descriptions, and a lightweight enhancer trained on base classes optimizes both support prototypes and query features under an inductive protocol with a consistency regularization to stabilize noisy captions. Experiments on four benchmarks show that PMCE consistently improves over strong baselines, achieving up to 7.71% absolute gain over the strongest semantic competitor on MiniImageNet in the 1-shot setting.

However, existing attention-based explanation methods rely on manually defined aggregation strategies and fixed attribution rules (Abnar and Zuidema, 2020a); (Chefer et al., 2021), while model-agnostic approaches (LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and incur significant computational costs through input perturbation.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis.

With the scaling of users and the emergence of denser storage media, the index has become a primary memory consumer, causing memory strain. Our extensive analysis of production traces reveals that write requests exhibit a strong tendency to target continuous block ranges in cloud storage systems. Thus, compared to current per-block indexing, our insight is that we should directly index block ranges (i.e., range-as-a-key) to save memory.\n  In this paper, we propose RASK, a memory-efficient and high-performance tree-structured index that natively indexes ranges. While range-as-a-key offers the potential to save memory and improve performance, realizing this idea is challenging due to the range overlap and range fragmentation issues. To handle range overlap efficiently, RASK introduces the log-structured leaf, combined with range-tailored search and garbage collection. To reduce range fragmentation, RASK employs range-aware split and merge mechanisms. Our evaluations on four production traces show that RASK reduces memory footprint by up to 98.9% and increases throughput by up to 31.0x compared to ten state-of-the-art indexes."}

This paper presents findings from a mixed-methods survey of 110 mobile app developers across 43 countries, examining how platform ecosystems (iOS vs. Android) and developer experience shape accessibility practices. Results show that while developers recognize the importance of accessibility, they often rely on platform-specific guidelines and typically perform compliance testing late in the development process.

To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control.

Accepted by ASPLOS 2026", "summary": "Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently attracted significant attention as it bridges AI with the physical world. Modern embodied AI systems often combine a Large Language Model (LLM)-based planner for high-level task planning and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller for low-level action generation, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks in real-world environments. However, deploying embodied agents remains challenging due to their high computation requirements, especially for battery-powered local devices. Although techniques like lowering operating voltage can improve energy efficiency, they can introduce bit errors and result in task failures. In this work, we propose CREATE, a general design principle that leverages heterogeneous resilience at different layers for synergistic energy-reliability co-optimization. For the first time, we conduct a comprehensive error injection study on modern embodied AI systems and observe an inherent but heterogeneous fault tolerance. Building upon these insights, we develop an anomaly detection and clearance mechanism at the circuit level to eliminate outlier errors. At the model level, we propose a weight-rotation-enhanced planning algorithm to improve the fault tolerance of the LLM-based planner. Furthermore, we introduce an application-level technique, autonomy-adaptive voltage scaling, to dynamically adjust the operating voltage of the controllers. The voltage scaling circuit is co-designed to enable online voltage adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that without compromising task quality, CREATE achieves 40.6% computational energy savings on average over nominal-voltage baselines and 35.0% over prior-art techniques. This further leads to 29.5% to 37.3% chip-level energy savings and approximately a 15% to 30% improvement in battery life."}

We investigate two widely adopted precoding strategies: (i) blockdiagonalization (BD) at the transmitter combined with maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receivers, and (ii) zero-forcing (ZF) precoding. Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical considerations such as channel fading, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead, and fairness-oriented power allocation.\n  Our contributions span both analytical and simulation-based fronts. On the analytical side, we derive analytical expressions for the achievable throughput under BD-MRC and ZF, highlighting the performance benefits of equipping multi-antenna users with cache-aided interference management. Specifically, we develop a low-complexity BD-MRC optimization method that leverages matrix structure to significantly reduce the dimensionality involved in precoding computation, followed by solving the associated maxmin fairness problem through an efficient one-dimensional search. In the massive MIMO regime, an asymptotic expression for the achievable throughput over Rayleigh fading channels is also derived. Simulations validate our theoretical results, confirming that VCC delivers substantial performance gains over optimized cacheless MU-MIMO systems. For example, with 32 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas per user, VCC yields throughput improvements exceeding 300%. These gains are further amplified under imperfect CSI at the transmitter, where VCC's ability to offload interference mitigation to the receivers ensures robust performance even in the face of degraded CSI quality and elevated acquisition costs."}

Traditional guardband-based design approaches, which rely on pessimistic timing margin, sacrifice significant performance and computational efficiency, rendering them inadequate for high-performance AI computing demands. Current reliability-aware AI accelerator design faces two core challenges: (1) the lack of systematic cross-layer analysis tools to capture coupling reliability effects across device, circuit, architecture, and application layers; and (2) the fundamental trade-off between conventional reliability optimization and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper systematically presents a series of reliability-aware accelerator designs, encompassing (1) aging and variation-aware dynamic timing analyzer, (2) accelerator dataflow optimization using critical input pattern reduction, and (3) resilience characterization and novel architecture design for large language models (LLMs). By tightly integrating cross-layer reliability modeling and AI workload characteristics, these co-optimization approaches effectively achieve reliable and efficient AI acceleration."}

Moreover, existing generative enhancement methods tend to be 3D-agnostic, resulting in inconsistent structures across views, especially in unseen regions. To overcome these challenges, we design a Dual-Domain Detail Perception Module, which enables handling high-resolution images without being limited by the ViT backbone, and endows Gaussians with additional features to store high-frequency details. We develop a feature-guided diffusion network, which can preserve high-frequency details during the restoration process.

In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code.

A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is generated by sequentially acquiring 1D depth-resolved raw A-scans (A-line) along the lateral axis (B-line), followed by Doppler phase-subtraction analysis. To ensure high-fidelity B-scan images, current practices rely on dense sampling, which prolongs scanning time, increases storage demands, and limits the capture of rapid blood flow dynamics. Recent studies have explored sparse sampling of raw A-scans to alleviate these limitations, but their effectiveness is hindered by the conservative sampling rates and the uniform modeling of flow and background signals. In this study, we introduce a novel blood flow-aware network, named ASBA (A-line ROI State space model and B-line phase Attention), to reconstruct ODT images from highly sparsely sampled raw A-scans. Specifically, we propose an A-line ROI state space model to extract sparsely distributed flow features along the A-line, and a B-line phase attention to capture long-range flow signals along each B-line based on phase difference. Moreover, we introduce a flow-aware weighted loss function that encourages the network to prioritize the accurate reconstruction of flow signals. Extensive experiments on real animal data demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art reconstruction methods."}

The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern neural models. We first operationalize a binary moral presence task (\"does any value appear?\") and show that it is learnable from single sentences (positive-class F1 $\\approx$ 0.74 with calibrated thresholds). We then compare a presence-gated hierarchy to a direct multi-label classifier under matched compute, both based on DeBERTa-base and augmented with lightweight signals (prior-sentence context, LIWC-22/eMFD/MJD lexica, and topic features). The hierarchy does not outperform direct prediction, indicating that gate recall limits downstream gains. We also benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs - Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, and Qwen 2.5 7B - in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups and build simple ensembles; a soft-vote supervised ensemble reaches macro-F1 0.332, significantly surpassing the best single supervised model and exceeding prior English-only baselines. Overall, in this scenario, lightweight signals and small ensembles yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. We argue that, under an 8 GB single-GPU constraint and at the 7-9B scale, carefully tuned supervised encoders remain a strong and compute-efficient baseline for structured human value detection, and we outline how richer value structure and sentence-in-document context could further improve performance."}

The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions.

Far from passive spectators, these actors co-produce propaganda, blending state-aligned messages with their own extremist framings. In Russia, such groups are central because they articulate the ideological foundations of the war against Ukraine and reflect the regime's gradual drift toward ultranationalist rhetoric. Drawing on a dataset of 200,000 images from expert-selected far-right Telegram channels, the study employs computer vision and unsupervised clustering to identify memes featuring Russian (Putin, Shoigu) and foreign politicians (Zelensky, Biden, Trump) and to reveal recurrent visual patterns in their representation. By leveraging the large-scale and temporal depth of this dataset, the analysis uncovers differential patterns of legitimation and delegitimation across actors and over time. These insights are not attainable in smaller-scale studies. Preliminary findings show that far-right memes function as instruments of propaganda co-production. These communities do not simply echo official messages but generate bottom-up narratives of legitimation and delegitimation that align with state ideology. By framing leaders as heroic and opponents as corrupt or weak, far-right actors act as informal co-creators of authoritarian legitimacy within Russia's informational autocracy."}

Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.

When stability cannot be achieved, algorithmicists and market designers face a critical question: how should instability be measured and distributed among participants? Existing approaches to \"almost-stable\" matchings focus on aggregate measures, minimising either the total number of blocking pairs or the count of agents involved in blocking pairs. However, such aggregate objectives can result in concentrated instability on a few individual agents, raising concerns about fairness and incentives to deviate. We introduce a fairness-oriented approach to approximate stability based on the minimax principle: we seek matchings that minimise the maximum number of blocking pairs any agent is in. Equivalently, we minimise the maximum number of agents that anyone has justified envy towards. This distributional objective protects the worst-off agents from a disproportionate amount of instability. We characterise the computational complexity of this notion across fundamental matching settings. Surprisingly, even very modest guarantees prove computationally intractable: we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists in which no agent is in more than one blocking pair, even when preference lists have constant-bounded length. This hardness applies to both Stable Roommates and maximum-cardinality Stable Marriage. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms when agents rank at most two others, and present approximation algorithms and integer programs. Our results map the algorithmic landscape and reveal fundamental trade-offs between distributional guarantees and computational feasibility."}

To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery."}

The method considers the Jacobian matrix of the forward map, i.e., of the map that sends the discretized conductivity to the electrode measurements, at an initial guess for the conductivity. The Jacobian matrix is divided columnwise into two parts: one corresponding to the region of interest and a nuisance Jacobian corresponding to the rest of the domain. The leading idea is to project both the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the span of a number of left-hand singular vectors for a suitably weighted nuisance Jacobian. The weighting can, e.g., account for the element sizes in a finite element discretization or to prior information on the conductivity outside the region of interest. The inverse problem is then solved by considering the projected relation between the measurements and the forward map, only reconstructing the conductivity in the region of interest. The functionality of the method is demonstrated by applying a reconstruction algorithm that combines lagged diffusivity iteration and total variation regularization to experimental data. In particular, data from a head-shaped water tank is considered, with the conductivity change in the region of interest mimicking growth of a hemorrhagic stroke and the changes outside the region of interest imitating physiological variations in the conductivity of the scalp."}

Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig. We use a constrained matching strategy with learned components, the DISK feature extractor, and the attention-based LightGlue matcher to generate high-quality sparse point clouds that are often unattainable with standard SfM pipelines.

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

The probe is a small auxiliary network whose computation is orders of magnitude cheaper than token generation and can be evaluated fully in parallel with inference, enabling near-instantaneous hallucination risk estimation with effectively zero added latency in low-risk cases. We deploy the probe as an agentic critic for fast selective generation and routing, allowing LLMs to immediately answer confident queries while delegating uncertain ones to stronger verification pipelines. Across four QA benchmarks and multiple LLM families, the method achieves strong AUROC and AURAC, generalizes under dataset shift, and reveals interpretable structure in intermediate representations, positioning fast internal uncertainty readout as a principled foundation for reliable agentic AI."}

This approach misses a different, and arguably more diagnostic, dimension of opinion change: whether deliberation reshuffles who agrees with whom, or simply moves everyone in parallel while preserving the pre-deliberation rank ordering. We introduce \\opinion mixing, measured by Kendall's rank correlation (τ) between pre- and post-deliberation responses, as a complement to variance-based polarization metrics. Across two large online deliberative polls spanning 32 countries (MCF-2022: n=6,342; MCF-2023: n=1,529), deliberation increases opinion mixing relative to survey-only controls: treatment groups exhibit lower rank correlation on (97%) and (93%) of opinion questions, respectively. Polarization measures based on variance tell a more heterogeneous story: controls consistently converge, while treated groups sometimes converge and sometimes diverge depending on the issue.\n  To probe mechanisms, we link transcripts and surveys in a third event (SOF: (n=617), 116 groups) and use LLM-assisted coding of 6,232 discussion statements. Expressed support in discussion statements strongly predicts subsequent group-level opinion shifts; this correlation is amplified by justification quality in the statements but not by argument novelty. To our knowledge, we are the first to observe how different notions of argument quality have different associations with the outcome of deliberation. This suggests that opinion change after deliberation is related to selective uptake of well-reasoned arguments, producing complex patterns of opinion reorganization that standard polarization metrics may miss."}

Each such stabilizer identified allows us to freely fix a bit in its support without affecting the logical state of the decoded result. This removes one degree of freedom that would otherwise require a symbolic guess, reducing the number of inactivated variables and decreasing the size of the final linear system that must be solved. We further show that dual peeling combined with standard peeling alone, without inactivation, is sufficient to achieve ML for erasure decoding of surface codes. Simulations across several QLDPC code families confirm that our decoder matches ML logical failure performance while significantly reducing the complexity of inactivation decoding, including more than a 20% reduction in symbolic guesses for the B1 lifted product code at high erasure rates."}

A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

Project page: https://github.com/UmeanNever/RankSurprisalRatio", "summary": "Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection."}

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation."}

Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \\equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence."}

An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes.

The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement.

As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents."}

A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator.

In such environments, equilibria that sustain activity generically operate at the boundary of viability. We show that this geometry endogenously reverses the value of information: greater informational precision increases the probability of collapse on every finite horizon. We formalize this mechanism through a limit-viability criterion, and model opacity as a strategic choice of the information structure via Blackwell garbling. When failure is absorbing, survival values become locally concave in beliefs, implying that transparency destroys equilibrium viability while sufficient opacity restores it.

However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions."}

In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable. We establish an upper bound for the suboptimality of the proposed algorithm, which reveals how the reduction in MSE of policy value estimation, enabled by our proposed weight-clipping estimator, leads to improved policy learning performance."}

Despite the critical importance of these molecular alterations, existing computational models often lack interpretability, and fail to integrate essential physicochemical interaction. To overcome these limitations, we propose SheafLapNet, a unified predictive framework grounded in the mathematical theory of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL). Unlike standard Topological Data Analysis (TDA) tools such as persistent homology, which are often insensitive to heterogeneous information, PSL explicitly encodes specific physical and chemical information such as partial charges directly into the topological analysis. SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes. By integrating these multi-perspective features, SheafLapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across these diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that sheaf-theoretic modeling significantly enhances both interpretability and generalizability in predicting mutation-induced structural and functional changes."}

While these mechanisms have been combined before, compression has typically been applied only to uplink (client-to-server) communication, leaving the downlink (server-to-client) side unaddressed. In practice, however, both directions are costly. We propose BiCoLoR, the first algorithm to combine local training with bidirectional compression using arbitrary unbiased compressors. This joint design achieves accelerated complexity guarantees in both convex and strongly convex heterogeneous settings. Empirically, BiCoLoR outperforms existing algorithms and establishes a new standard in communication efficiency."}

Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance.

We develop a three-layer general equilibrium framework to study how this non-convex technology reshapes market structure, transition dynamics, and social welfare. In a static vertical differentiation model, we show that the GenAI cost shock induces a kinked production frontier that bifurcates the market into exit, AI, and human segments, generating a ``middle-class hollow'' in the quality distribution. To analyze adjustment paths, we embed this structure in a mean-field evolutionary system and a calibrated agent-based model with bounded rationality. The transition to the AI-integrated equilibrium is non-monotonic: rather than smooth diffusion, the economy experiences a temporary ecological collapse driven by search frictions and delayed skill adaptation, followed by selective recovery. Survival depends on asymmetric skill reconfiguration, whereby humans retreat from technical execution toward semantic creativity. Finally, we show that the welfare impact of AI adoption is highly sensitive to pollution intensity: low congestion yields monotonic welfare gains, whereas high pollution produces an inverted-U relationship in which further AI expansion reduces total welfare. These results imply that laissez-faire adoption can be inefficient and that optimal governance must shift from input regulation toward output-side congestion management."}

To test this theory, we trained an end-to-end deep recurrent neural network using reinforcement learning on a noisy perceptual discrimination task. Networks learned several key abilities of primate-like decision making including trading off speed for accuracy, and flexibly changing their mind in the face of new information. Internal dynamics of these networks suggest that these abilities were supported by similar decision mechanisms as those observed in primate neurophysiological studies.

Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols.

The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs.

Using citations as a proxy, we quantify disparities in attention by gender and institutional prestige. We find that women receive systematically fewer citations than men, and that attention is increasingly concentrated among authors from elite institutions -- patterns not fully explained by underrepresentation alone. To explain these dynamics, we introduce a model of citation network growth that incorporates homophily (tendency to cite similar authors), preferential attachment (favoring highly cited authors) and group size (underrepresentation). The model shows that disparities arise not only from group size imbalances but also from cumulative advantage amplifying biased citation preferences. Importantly, increasing representation alone is often insufficient to reduce disparities. Effective strategies should also include reducing homophily, amplifying the visibility of underrepresented groups, and supporting equitable integration of newcomers. Our findings highlight the challenges of mitigating inequities in asymmetric networks like citations, where recognition flows in one direction.

Here, we propose a cognition space approach that replaces narrow, substrate-dependent definitions with a comparative representation based on organizational and informational dimensions. Within this framework, cognition is treated as a graded capacity to sense, process, and act upon information, allowing systems as diverse as cells, brains, artificial agents, and human-AI collectives to be analyzed within a common conceptual landscape. We introduce and examine three cognition spaces -- basal aneural, neural, and human-AI hybrid -- and show that their occupation is highly uneven, with clusters of realized systems separated by large unoccupied regions. We argue that these voids are not accidental but reflect evolutionary contingencies, physical constraints, and design limitations. By focusing on the structure of cognition spaces rather than on categorical definitions, this approach clarifies the diversity of existing cognitive systems and highlights hybrid cognition as a promising frontier for exploring novel forms of complexity beyond those produced by biological evolution."}

Indeed, the scarcity of SPAD datasets hinders the development of SPAD-specific processing algorithms and impedes the training of learning-based solutions.\n  In this paper, we present a comprehensive SPAD simulation pipeline and validate it with multiple experiments using two recent commercial SPAD sensors. Our simulator is used to generate the SPAD-MNIST, a single-photon version of the seminal MNIST dataset, to investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on reconstructed fluxes, even at extremely low light conditions, e.g., 5 mlux.

However, these apparent successes break down under trading backtests: models like GANs or WGAN-GP frequently collapse, yielding extreme and unrealistic results that make the synthetic data unusable in practice. We identify the root cause in the neglect of financial asymmetry and rare tail events, which strongly affect market risk but are often overlooked by objectives focusing on distribution matching. To address this, we introduce the Stylized Facts Alignment GAN (SFAG), which converts key stylized facts into differentiable structural constraints and jointly optimizes them with adversarial loss. This multi-constraint design ensures that generated series remain aligned with market dynamics not only in plots but also in backtesting. Experiments on the Shanghai Composite Index (2004--2024) show that while baseline GANs produce unstable and implausible trading outcomes, SFAG generates synthetic data that preserve stylized facts and support robust momentum strategy performance. Our results highlight that structure-preserving objectives are essential to bridge the gap between superficial realism and practical usability in financial generative modeling."}

Yet most neuromorphic and photonic systems still digitize events into timestamps, bins, or rates and then perform selection in clocked logic. We introduce Polychronous Wave Computing (PWC), a timing-native address-selection primitive that maps relative spike latencies directly to a discrete output route in the wave domain. Spike times are phase-encoded in a rotating frame and processed by a programmable multiport interferometer that evaluates K template correlations in parallel; a driven--dissipative winner-take-all stage then performs a physical argmax, emitting a one-hot output port. We derive the operating envelope imposed by phase wrapping and mutual coherence, and collapse timing jitter, static phase mismatch, and dephasing into a single effective phase-noise budget whose induced winner--runner-up margin predicts boundary-first failures and provides an intensity-only calibration target. Simulations show that nonlinear competition improves routing fidelity compared with noisy linear intensity readout, and that hardware-in-the-loop phase tuning rescues a temporal-order gate from 55.9% to 97.2% accuracy under strong static mismatch. PWC provides a fast routing coprocessor for LUT-style spiking networks and sparse top-1 gates (e.g., mixture-of-experts routing) across polaritonic, photonic, and oscillator platforms."}

Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness."}

We conduct an experimental survey with 1,700 recruiters from the United Kingdom and the United States. Using a paired conjoint design, recruiters evaluated hypothetical candidates represented by synthetically designed resumes. Across three occupations - graphic designer, office assistant, and software engineer - AI skills significantly increase interview invitation probabilities by approximately 8 to 15 percentage points. AI skills also partially or fully offset disadvantages related to age and lower education, with effects strongest for office assistants, where formal AI certification plays an additional compensatory role. Effects are weaker for graphic designers, consistent with more skeptical recruiter attitudes toward AI in creative work. Finally, recruiters' own background and AI usage significantly moderate these effects. Overall, the findings demonstrate that AI skills function as a powerful hiring signal and can mitigate traditional labour market disadvantages, with implications for workers' skill acquisition strategies and firms' recruitment practices."}

We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \\ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases.

In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.

Here, we present an end-to-end reverse screening strategy leveraging HelixFold3, a high-accuracy biomolecular structure prediction model akin to AlphaFold3, which simultaneously models the folding of proteins from a protein library and the docking of small-molecule ligands within a unified framework. We validate this approach on a diverse and representative set of approximately one hundred small molecules.

They allow researchers to separate image content from image understanding, making them valuable for studying visual perception. An ideal Mooney image for this purpose achieves a specific balance: it initially appears unrecognizable but becomes fully interpretable to the observer after seeing the original template. Researchers traditionally created these stimuli manually using subjective criteria, which is labor-intensive and can introduce inconsistencies across studies. Automated generation techniques now offer an alternative to this manual approach. Here, we present MooneyMaker, an open-source Python package that automates the generation of ambiguous Mooney images using several complementary approaches. Users can choose between various generation techniques that range from approaches based on image statistics to deep learning models. These models strategically alter edge information to increase initial ambiguity. The package lets users create two-tone images with multiple methods and directly compare the results visually. In an experiment, we validate MooneyMaker by generating Mooney images using different techniques and assess their recognizability for human observers before and after disambiguating them by presenting the template images. Our results reveal that techniques with lower initial recognizability are associated with higher post-template recognition (i.e. a larger disambiguation effect). To help vision scientists build effective databases of Mooney stimuli, we provide practical guidelines for technique selection. By standardizing the generation process, MooneyMaker supports more consistent and reproducible visual perception research."}

Our first result shows that the basis number of a graph is at most four times its pathwidth. Our second result shows that, if a graph $G$ has a path decomposition with adhesions of size at most $k$ in which the graph induced by each bag has basis number at most $b$, then $G$ has basis number at most $b+O(k\\log^2 k)$. The first result, combined with recent work of Geniet and Giocanti shows that the basis number of a graph is bounded by a polynomial function of its treewidth. The second result (also combined with the work of Geniet and Giocanti) shows that every $K_t$-minor-free graph has a basis number bounded by a polynomial function of $t$."}

In this work, we focus on a dynamic setting in which the graph grows over time, and at each step we burn vertices in the growing grid $G_n = [-f(n),f(n)]^2$. We investigate the set of achievable burning densities for functions of the form $f(n)=\\lceil cn^α\\rceil$, where $α\\ge 1$ and $c>0$. We show that for $α=1$, the set of achievable densities is $[1/(2c^2),1]$, for $1<α<3/2$, every density in $[0,1]$ is achievable, and for $α=3/2$, the set of achievable densities is $[0,(1+\\sqrt{6}c)^{-2}]$."}

We compare different architectures, from fully connected neural networks to transformers, and we test different design/training modalities, identifying sequence-to-sequence, attention-based models as the most effective on our datasets. These models consistently produce mitigated distributions that are closer to the ideal outputs when tested on both simulated and real device data obtained from IBM superconducting quantum processing units (QPU) up to five qubits. Across several different circuit depths, our approach outperforms other baseline error mitigation techniques. We perform a series of ablation studies to examine: how different input features (circuit, device properties, noisy output statistics) affect performance; cross-dataset generalization across circuit families; and transfer learning to a different IBM QPU. We observe that generalization performance across similar devices with the same architecture works effectively, without needing to fully retrain models."}
