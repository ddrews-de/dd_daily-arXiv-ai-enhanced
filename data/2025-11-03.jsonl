However, most existing\nalgorithms are developed for static, low-dimensional data and struggle with\ntemporal dependence, unequal sequence lengths, high dimensionality, and\ncontamination by noise or artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce\nRFCPCA, a robust fuzzy subspace-clustering method explicitly tailored to MTS\nthat, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to simultaneously:\n(i) learn membership-informed subspaces, (ii) accommodate unequal lengths and\nmoderately high dimensions, (iii) achieve robustness through trimming,\nexponential reweighting, and a dedicated noise cluster, and (iv) automatically\nselect all required hyperparameters.

While model-agnostic frameworks\nsuch as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely\nalign with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after.\nCounterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of\nwhich circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome,\nmay be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate\ncounterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features\nare most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of\ncounterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning,\nexploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model\nitself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the\nexplanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are\ncrossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this\nmethod on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit\ndataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more\nuseful than Shapley values."}

In some cases, estimators for the sampling\nvariance of a given effect size statistic may not exist, necessitating the\nderivation of a new formula for sampling variance. Traditionally, sampling\nvariance formulas are obtained via hand-derived Taylor expansions (the delta\nmethod), though this procedure can be challenging for non-statisticians.\nBuilding on the idea of single-fit parametric resampling, we introduce SAFE\nbootstrap: a Single-fit, Accurate, Fast, and Easy simulation recipe that\nreplaces potentially complex algebra with four intuitive steps: fit, draw,\ntransform, and summarise. In a unified framework, the SAFE bootstrap yields\nbias-corrected point estimates and standard errors for any effect size\nstatistic, regardless of whether the outcome is continuous or discrete. SAFE\nbootstrapping works by drawing once from a simple sampling model (normal,\nbinomial, etc.), converting each replicate into any effect size of interest and\nthen calculating the bias and sampling variance from simulated data. We\ndemonstrate how to implement the SAFE bootstrap for a simple example first, and\nthen for common effect sizes, such as the standardised mean difference and log\nodds ratio, as well as for less common effect sizes.

We prove that the DDPM sampler\nwith accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of\n$$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d\\min\\{d,L^2\\}}{T^2}\\right)~\\text{in\nKullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the\nnumber of iterations, and $\\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$.\nThis result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L <\n\\sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence\nanalysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions. Moreover, it\nreveals that DDPM and DDIM share the same dependence on $d$, raising an\ninteresting question of why DDIM often appears empirically faster."}

Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We\nexplore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a\nmodel to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal\nactivations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we\nintroduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant\ncues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets.

That is, to make the channel-aware approach\nmore practical, the challenge that the heavy reliance on the global ICSI and\ndecision fusion rule in obtaining the Byzantine attacks is successfully\nrelaxed. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis through\nextensive simulations across a wide range of attacking scenarios."}

Our approach introduces two key technical\ninnovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by\nhooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware\naggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant\nenhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,\nexcelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In\naddition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as\na plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.\nExtensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text\ngeneration, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and\ncompatibility of our approach.

To address this, we leverage\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising\nnetwork that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a\ntransformer layer.

In this paper, we\nask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual\nscene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding\nmethods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance\nof human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new\napproach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only\nachieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far\ninsufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis\nand human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to\nseamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint\ntext and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise\ngeneration of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent\nare both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image\nreconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while\nusing much less bandwidth.

While the discovery of decodable neural\nrepresentations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsuggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly\nindependent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a\nconvergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse\nevaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the\nValence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what\nis good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\"). Through\ndirect interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical\ndependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative\nprocess to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at\nthe cost of factual accuracy.

It has been theorized that this delay\nheterogeneity, rather than a cost to be minimized, can be exploited in embodied\ncontexts where task-relevant information naturally sits contextually in the\ntime domain. We test this hypothesis by training spiking neural networks to\nmodify not only their weights but also their delays at different levels of\nprecision. We find that delay heterogeneity enables state-of-the-art\nperformance on temporally complex neuromorphic problems and can be achieved\neven when weights are extremely imprecise (1.58-bit ternary precision: just\npositive, negative, or absent).

In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks.

We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream.

Traditional preconditioners\nrely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while\nlimiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on\nincomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated\ntriangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces\nlong-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss\nfunction. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs.

To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a\ngraph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in\nformulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents\noptimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph\nisomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging\nORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs\non optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization\nmodeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4\nachieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even\nleading reasoning models."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}

In stark contrast, the human brain operates efficiently\non only ~20 watts, and individual cells process gigabit-scale genetic\ninformation using energy on the order of trillionths of a watt. Under the same\nenergy budget, a general-purpose digital processor can perform only a few\nsimple operations per second. This striking disparity suggests that biological\nsystems follow algorithms fundamentally distinct from conventional computation.\nThe framework of information thermodynamics-especially Maxwell's demon and the\nSzilard engine-offers a theoretical clue, setting the lower bound of energy\nrequired for information processing. However, digital processors exceed this\nlimit by about six orders of magnitude. Recent single-molecule studies have\nrevealed that biological molecular motors convert Brownian motion into\nmechanical work, realizing a \"demon-like\" operational principle. These findings\nsuggest that living systems have already implemented an ultra-efficient\ninformation-energy conversion mechanism that transcends digital computation.\nHere, we experimentally establish a quantitative correspondence between\npositional information (bits) and mechanical work, demonstrating that molecular\nmachines selectively exploit rare but functional fluctuations arising from\nBrownian motion to achieve ATP-level energy efficiency. This integration of\ninformation, energy, and timescale indicates that life realizes a Maxwell's\ndemon-like mechanism for energy-efficient information processing."}

We use\nreinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in\norder to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast\nto the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes\nmodel accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the\nmarket (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market\nmaker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the\nhigh-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement\nlearning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises\nProximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate\nthe adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium\nfrequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with\ntraining against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent\nlearns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent\nempirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly\nsubject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As\nhigh-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the\nslippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over\ntime. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making\nRL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Structures of multilinear maps are characterized by invariants. In this paper\nwe introduce two invariants, named the isotropy index and the completeness\nindex. These invariants capture the tensorial structure of the kernel of a\nmultilinear map. We establish bounds on both indices in terms of the partition\nrank, geometric rank, analytic rank and height, and present three applications:\n1) Using the completeness index as an interpolator, we establish upper bounds\non the aforementioned tensor ranks in terms of the subrank. This settles an\nopen problem raised by Kopparty, Moshkovitz and Zuiddam, and consequently\nanswers a question of Derksen, Makam and Zuiddam. 2) We prove a Ramsey-type\ntheorem for the two indices, generalizing a recent result of Qiao and\nconfirming a conjecture of his. 3) By computing the completeness index, we\nobtain a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm to estimate the height of a\npolynomial ideal."}

The retail\nsector is a critical player, mediating product flows between producers and\nconsumers, where supply chain inefficiencies can shape which items are put on\nsale. Yet how these dynamics vary across geographic contexts remains largely\nunexplored. Here, we analyze data from Denmark's largest retail group on\nnear-expiry products put on sale. We uncover the geospatial variations using a\ndual-clustering approach. We identify multi-scale spatial relationships in\nretail organization by correlating store clustering -- measured using\nshortest-path distances along the street network -- with product clustering\nbased on promotion co-occurrence patterns. Using a bipartite network approach,\nwe identify three regional store clusters, and use percolation thresholds to\ncorroborate the scale of their spatial separation. We find that stores in rural\ncommunities put meat and dairy products on sale up to 2.2 times more frequently\nthan metropolitan areas. In contrast, we find that metropolitan and capital\nregions lean toward convenience products, which have more balanced nutritional\nprofiles but less favorable environmental impacts. By linking geographic\ncontext to retail inventory, we provide evidence that reducing food waste\nrequires interventions tailored to local retail dynamics, highlighting the\nimportance of region-specific sustainability strategies."}

In the\nbaseline treatment, participants set prices themselves.

Participants delegate more when they can override the algorithm's\ndecisions. In both algorithmic treatments, prices are lower than in the\nbaseline.

Empirical and computational studies show that optimal\ninformation sharing that is neither too localized nor too diffuse, can enhance\nresource detection and coordination. Building on these insights, we develop a\nrandomized search model that integrates social learning with area-restricted\nsearch (ARS) to investigate how communication distance affects collective\nforaging. The model includes three behavioral modes: exploration, exploitation,\nand targeted walk, which are governed by a single parameter, $\\rho$, that\nbalances exploration and exploitation at the group level. We quantify how\n$\\rho$ influences group efficiency ($\\eta$), temporal variability/burstiness\n($B$), and agent variability/equity in resource distribution ($\\sigma$),\nrevealing a clear trade-off among these outcomes. When $\\rho \\to 0$, agents\nexplore independently, maximizing collective exploration. As $\\rho$ increases,\nindividuals preferentially exploit patches discovered by others: $\\eta$ first\nrises and then declines, while $B$ shows the opposite trend. Group efficiency\nis optimized at interior $\\rho$ values that balance exploration and\nexploitation. At the largest $\\rho$, equality among agents is highest, but\nefficiency declines and burstiness is maximized too. Finally, by introducing\nnegative rewards, we examine how social learning mitigates risk."}
