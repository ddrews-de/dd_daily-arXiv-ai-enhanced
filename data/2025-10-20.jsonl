For single channel\ntime-distance two-dimensional echo signals, effective range bins are selected\nbased on the respiratory/cardiac physiological frequency band energy ratio, and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of respiration/heart signals is enhanced using\nphase-aligned maximal ratio combining (MRC). Stage 2: Multi-Channel Fusion\nBased on Organ Radiation Spatial Distribution Characteristics. The spatial\nradiation characteristics of cardiopulmonary organs are introduced for the\nffrst time as the theoretical foundation for SNR-based channel screening,\nchannel attribute identiffcation, and multi-channel weighted fusion. Then, we\npropose a template matching method to extract respiratory rate (RR) and heart\nrate (HR) by adopting physical models of respiration and cardiac activities.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the existence of the spatial distribution\ncharacteristics of organ radiation. In addition, we analyzed the impact of\ndistance and state on the algorithm from these two aspects."}

Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to\nspecific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus\nlimiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM\nframeworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models\n(VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They\nmainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic\ninformation, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with\nunderstanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric\nEntropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It\nestablishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the\ncodec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and\ndiscard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional\nentropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of\nvideo decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps\nthe codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while\nsqueezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion\n(SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through\nsemantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves\nmachine-oriented reconstruction quality.

We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely\npassive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that\ncaptures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the\ncognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all\nvehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash\nequilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we\ndevelop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation\nvia vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to\nboth offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed\ntrajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned\nparameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios\ndemonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to\nnoisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The\nresults validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online\nimplementations."}

Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal\noperator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from\nthe empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest\nfeq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional\nsubspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse\nstructure while suppressing noise.

We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads.

In this\nscenario, the measurement matrix $Q$ acts as a one time pad encryption key (in\ncomplex number domain) which can achieve perfect information-theoretic security\ntogether with other benefits such as reduced complexity and energy efficiency\nparticularly useful in IoT. However, unless the matrix is changed for every\nmessage it is vulnerable towards known plain text attacks: only $n$\nobservations suffices to recover a key $Q$ with $n$ columns. In this paper, we\ninvent and analyze a new method (termed 'Bilinear Compressive Security (BCS)')\naddressing these shortcomings: In addition to the linear encoding of the\nmessage $x$ with a matrix $Q$, the sender convolves the resulting vector with a\nrandomly generated filter $h$. Assuming that $h$ and $x$ are sparse, the\nreceiver can then recover $x$ without knowledge of $h$ from $y=h*Qx$ through\nblind deconvolution. We study a rather idealized known plaintext attack for\nrecovering $Q$ from repeated observations of $y$'s for different, known $x_k$,\nwith varying and unknown $h$ ,giving Eve a number of advantages not present in\npractice. Our main result for BCS states that under a weak symmetry condition\non the filter $h$, recovering $Q$ will require extensive sampling from\ntransmissions of $\\Omega\\left(\\max\\left(n,(n/s)^2\\right)\\right)$ messages $x_k$\nif they are $s$-sparse. Remarkably, with $s=1$ it is impossible to recover the\nkey. In this way, the scheme is much safer than standard compressed sensing\neven though our assumptions are much in favor towards a potential attacker."}

In this work, we present the first general-purpose\napplication of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical\nimaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior\ntrained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward\nmodels that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,\nbias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further\ndemonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning\nmethods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical\nand research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring\npaired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion\npriors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis."}

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit.

This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs\nfor both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply\nUniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and\ninterleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs\npre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced\ncapabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving\nstronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual\nsupervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger\nperformance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of\nhigh-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data\nused for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the\nhigh-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to\nthe community for reproduction and further development."}

Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple\nsources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the\nability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with\nDiagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first\npublicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and\nechocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD\ndetection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture\nthat incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations\nfrom image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image\nand tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score\nof 79.8 $\\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset.

To\nevaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for\nassessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of\ninstruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length\ncontrol. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and\nDeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:\nthe highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that\nfewer than $25\\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.\nNotably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades\nfurther.

Since the buyer gains greater utility through\nbetter decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the\nseller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones.

Data was divided\ninto two periods: pre-AI and post-AI. For PE-positive exams, TAT - defined as\nthe duration from patient scan completion to the first preliminary report\ncompletion - was compared between the two periods. Time-savings were reported\nseparately for work-hour and off-hour cohorts. To characterize radiologist\nworkflow, 527234 records were retrieved from the PACS and workflow parameters\nsuch as exam inter-arrival time and radiologist read-time extracted.

Results: The pre-AI dataset included 4694 chest CTPA exams with\n13.3% being PE-positive. The post-AI dataset comprised 6558 exams with 16.2%\nbeing PE-positive. The mean TAT for pre-AI and post-AI during work hours are\n68.9 [95% CI\" 55.0, 82.8] and 46.7 [38.1, 55.2] minutes respectively, and those\nduring off-hours are 44.8 [33.7, 55.9] and 42.0 [33.6, 50.3] minutes.\nClinically-observed time-savings during work hours (22.2 [95% CI: 5.85, 38.6]\nminutes) were significant (p=0.004), while off-hour (2.82 [-11.1, 16.7]\nminutes) were not (p=0.345). Observed time-savings aligned with model\npredictions (29.6 [95% range: 23.2, 38.1] minutes for work hours; 2.10 [1.76,\n2.58] minutes for off-hours).

Pre-CR version", "summary": "Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a\ncornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient\ncare, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for\nadvancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their\nunstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts\nmake automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements\nin natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as\nequally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across\nclinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively\ngeneralize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present\nTACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to\naddress these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts\nduring training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL\ndynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual\nsamples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler\ncases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling\nmore complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including\nEnglish and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements\nacross diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission\nprediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the\nperformance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify\napproaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,\nscalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions."}

DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers\nare collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and\nrobust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is\napplied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness\n(WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal\nprobability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing\nprovides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by\nensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space\nperturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets\ndemonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification\nperformance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks."}

In addition to convergence in training,\ncorrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human\npreferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the\nexisting literature does not include specifications for goals that are both\ncorrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a\nformal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that\nconstructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,\nwithout sacrificing performance.

To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of\nthe LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over\nvocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an\neigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,\nwe propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework.

In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is\ndiscarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens\nautonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT\nsets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while\ncutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent\nmethods.

The\ncore of PRISM is the statistical method that provides a quantifiable measure\nfor probabilistic guarantees on training time. Using PRISM, we explore the\ndesign and optimization space of distributed training, from parallelization\nmethods to next-generation training systems. PRISM is validated with\nreal-system measurement, showing training time prediction accuracy with 20.8%\nKolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Using PRISM, we demonstrate that, depending on\ncomputation node placement, up to 1.26x performance improvement potential is\navailable if we factor in sensitivities of parallelization strategies to\nvariation. In addition, we use PRISM to identify kernels to optimize for\nreducing performance variability and predict probability of slow-down for\nlarge-scale jobs where variation is magnified. We find optimizing communication\nkernels, such as AllGather and ReduceScatter, contribute most to minimizing\nvariability in training step time."}

Yet, training data for this task is scarce,\nand existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --\nstruggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We\nintroduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean\nproofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is\ntrained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify\nsimplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates\nwithin an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof\nlength. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs\ngenerated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,\nreducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on\nSeed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check\nfaster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as\ntraining data for supervised finetuning."}

However, completing a\nphysical assessment is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality raw data\nand poor harmonization across industry classification systems used in data\nreporting. Here we describe a new physical extension for the U.S. Department of\nEnergy's (DOE's) EEIO for Industrial Decarbonization (EEIO-IDA) model, yielding\nan expanded EEIO model that is both physically and environmentally extended. In\nthe model framework, the U.S. economy is divided into goods-producing and\nservice-producing subsectors, and mass flows are quantified for each\ngoods-producing subsector using a combination of trade data (e.g., UN Comtrade)\nand physical production data (e.g., U.S. Geological Survey). Given that\nprimary-source production data are not available for all subsectors,\nprice-imputation and mass-balance assumptions are developed and used to\ncomplete the physical flows dataset with high-quality estimations. The\nresulting dataset, when integrated with the EEIO-IDA tool, enables the\nquantification of environmental impact intensity metrics on a mass basis (e.g.,\nCO$_2$eq/kg)) for each industrial subsector. This work is designed to align\nwith existing DOE frameworks and tools, including the EEIO-IDA tool, the DOE\nIndustrial Decarbonization Roadmap (2022), and Pathways for U.S. Industrial\nTransformations study (2025)."}

While this choice is intensely debated, its\nunderlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period\ngame-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value\nchain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant\ndeveloper. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to\nthe entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a \"data\nflywheel effect,\" whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the\ndeployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's\noptimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of\nthe data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very\nstrong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an\nintermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's\nlearning. This dynamic gives rise to an \"openness trap,\" a critical policy\nparadox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic\nflexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to\nshow that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical\nintegration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel\neffect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient\ncompetitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be\ncaptured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness\nadjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the\ndeveloper's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we\nprovide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective\npolicy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem."}
