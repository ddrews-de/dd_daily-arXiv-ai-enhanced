This reduced practical context window\ncreates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex\ntool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this\ntrade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by\nthree synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized\nLoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and\nstructured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool\nschemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time\nschema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool\nselection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to\ncontext-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a\nconventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the\nperformance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context,\nachieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a\n10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction\nverbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking\ncapable and persistent on-device AI."}

Yet the best models still suffer from\nhallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap\nbetween their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks\nthat are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning.

Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training.

Safety Stock\ndimensioning-the computation of the appropriate safety stock quantity-is one of\nseveral mechanisms to ensure supply chain resiliency, as it protects the supply\nchain against demand and supply uncertainties. Unfortunately, the major\napproaches to dimensioning safety stock heavily assume that demand is normally\ndistributed and ignore future demand variability, limiting their applicability\nin manufacturing contexts where demand is non-normal, intermittent, and highly\nskewed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that relaxes the\nassumption of normality, enabling the demand distribution of each inventory\nitem to be analytically determined using Kernel Density Estimation. Also, we\nextended the analysis from historical demand variability to forecasted demand\nvariability. We evaluated the proposed approach against a normal distribution\nmodel in a near-world inventory replenishment simulation. Afterwards, we used a\nlinear optimization model to determine the optimal safety stock configuration.\nThe results from the simulation and linear optimization models showed that the\ndata-driven approach outperformed traditional approaches. In particular, the\ndata-driven approach achieved the desired service levels at lower safety stock\nlevels than the conventional approaches."}

It is known that the KR\nrearrangement can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of optimal transport\nmaps with a weighted quadratic cost. We extend these results in this work by\nshowing that one can obtain the KR map as a limit of maps that solve a\nrelaxation of the weighted-cost optimal transport problem with a\nsoft-constraint for the target distribution. In addition, we show that this\nprocedure also applies to the construction of triangular velocity fields via\ndynamic optimal transport yielding optimal velocity fields. This justifies\nvarious variational methodologies for estimating KR maps in practice by\nminimizing a divergence between the target and pushforward measure through an\napproximate map. Moreover, it opens the possibilities for novel static and\ndynamic OT estimators for KR maps."}

However, two key limitations restrict\ntheir practical use: (1) users often require operations beyond separation, such\nas sound removal; and (2) relying solely on text prompts can be unintuitive for\nspecifying sound sources. In this paper, we propose PromptSep to extend LASS\ninto a broader framework for general-purpose sound separation. PromptSep\nleverages a conditional diffusion model enhanced with elaborated data\nsimulation to enable both audio extraction and sound removal. To move beyond\ntext-only queries, we incorporate vocal imitation as an additional and more\nintuitive conditioning modality for our model, by incorporating Sketch2Sound as\na data augmentation strategy.

RAMP converges quickly\nwithin five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and\nself-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that\nRAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,\nand runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair\nstrategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging\ntools to under-studied languages."}

However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT\nattains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while\nmaintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.\nCode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/BiscuitsLzy/DMSORT-An-efficient-parallel-maritime-multi-object-tracking-architecture-."}

The second theme addresses the documentary value of data and\ncorpora, understood as the relevance of materials for documenting a research\nobject in relation to the goals and perspectives of the projects in which they\nare used. This value depends both on provenance and reasoned selection, and on\nthe pragmatic context of their use. The third theme distinguishes between data\ncollections, corpora, and archives. A data collection constitutes a potential\nreservoir of materials, whereas a corpus results from a reasoned and\ncontextualized selection from this collection, elaborated in relation to a\nspecific project. Archives, in turn, refer both to open data repositories and\nto research resources that support experimentation, editorialization, and\nvalorization. This distinction highlights the dynamic nature of the processes\nof constituting and reusing digital resources. The fourth theme explores the\nsemantic enrichment of data, understood as the set of semiotic and technical\noperations that give meaning to data, establish relationships among them, and\nmake them usable by social actors. This approach raises issues related to the\ndescription, classification, and interconnection of data, notably through the\nuse of ontologies, metadata, and models for knowledge representation. Semantic\nenrichment thus forms part of a broader reflection on value creation and data\nreuse in diverse contexts. Finally, the fifth theme addresses the\ninstrumentation of research, that is, the digital environments, tools, and\ninfrastructures that support the production, management, and dissemination of\ncorpora. These technical systems - collaborative platforms, annotation,\nanalysis, and publication tools - form an essential component of the digital\nhumanities ecosystem and condition new forms of archiving, circulation, and\nknowledge transmission. In conclusion, the article emphasizes three central\nquestions: how to construct meaning from data; how to model strategies of\nappropriation, reuse, and re-publication; and how to organize new semiotic and\ncultural ecosystems of research. The overall challenge lies in understanding\nhow audiovisual data can be transformed into genuine objects of knowledge and\nvalue within contemporary scientific, technical, and cultural frameworks."}

To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel.

While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the\ntheoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially\nunderdeveloped.\n  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria.\nWe show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher\nmarket equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa.\nThe dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence\nbetween the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and\nprices.\n  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation\nand dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments\nfor Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze\nwelfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we\nprove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For\nconcave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves\n$(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is\ntight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including\nproportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\\^atonnement. We obtain new market\ndynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher\nmarket. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements\nutilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the\nduality framework to markets with chores.

Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a\nnatural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While\nthe problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent\nsettings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In\nthis work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized\nmulti-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the\ntransition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying\nnovel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.\nOur main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on\nthe construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our\nregret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the\ninherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs.

Unlike simple row or column permutations that merely reorder existing\nelements, the proposed local modification introduces genuine structural\nrandomness through small $2\\times2$ cross-swap operations followed by\ninteger-linear-program-based local repairs that restore orthogonality. By\napplying this procedure repeatedly in a random manner, ensembles of randomized\nquantum LDPC codes can be constructed. The computational complexity of each\nrepair depends only on the maximum row and column weights and is independent of\nthe overall matrix size, ensuring scalability to large code blocks."}

Mande", "Subhasree Patro", "Nithish Raja", "Swagato Sanyal"], "title": "Quantum Search With Generalized Wildcards", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.CC"], "comment": null, "summary": "In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum\nInf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \\in\n\\{-1,1\\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the\nhidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a\nquantum algorithm of cost $O(\\sqrt{n} \\log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound\nof $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$ upper bound.\n  We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a\nsubset $\\cal{Q} \\subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S =\nb$ for an arbitrary $S \\in \\cal{Q}$ and $b \\in \\{-1,1\\}^S$ of its choice, at\nunit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\\cal{Q}$ is any of the following\ncollections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full\nset.\n  All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using\nsymmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of\nlearning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization\nprogram, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd\nfunctions $f : \\{-1,1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$\nto the maximum (over $T \\in \\cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube\nwhose free variables are exactly $T$.'\n  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal\nversion of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program\ntypically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds\nwithout explicitly resorting to SDP duality."}

This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)\npipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic\nDark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for\na forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model\nbased on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one\nmillion self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.\nLeveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural\nnetworks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn\nlow-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with\ntarget parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation\nof the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter\nspace spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias\nparameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear\nbias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference\npipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic\ncontaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.\nOur forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter\nconstraints, achieving $2-3\\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\\Omega_m -\nS_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and\neffectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for\nupcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys."}
