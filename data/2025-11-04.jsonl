Traditional\nleast-squares methods require prohibitive pilot overhead that scales with\nantenna count, while sparse estimation methods depend on precise channel models\nthat may not always be practical. This paper proposes a model-free approach\ncombining deep autoencoders and LSTM networks. The method first learns\nlow-dimensional channel representations preserving temporal correlation through\naugmenting a channel charting-inspired loss function, then tracks these\nfeatures to recover full channel information from limited pilots. Simulation\nresults using ray-tracing datasets show that the proposed approach achieves up\nto 9 dB improvement in normalized mean square error compared to the\nleast-squares methods under ill-conditioned scenarios, while maintaining\nscalability across MIMO configurations."}

NSO features key innovations such as\nfitness-based synaptic weight updates to improve search influence, adaptive\npruning to minimize computational overhead, and dual guidance from global and\nlocal best solutions to balance exploration and exploitation. The algorithm was\nbenchmarked against popular metaheuristics and the recently published\nHippopotamus Optimization Algorithm (HOA) using the CEC 2014 test suite,\nencompassing unimodal, multimodal, and composition function landscapes.\nFindings: Benchmark results reveal that NSO consistently outperforms HOA and\nother major algorithms in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and\nscalability. NSO demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency,\nparticularly in complex, high-dimensional search spaces. Originality: NSO\nintroduces a unique blend of neural-inspired mechanisms with dynamic resource\nallocation, setting it apart from existing algorithms. Its innovative design\nenhances search performance while reducing computational cost. With promising\napplications in technology, healthcare, data science, and engineering, NSO\npaves the way for future research into dynamic and multi-objective\noptimization, machine learning hyperparameter tuning, and real-world\nengineering design problems."}

As the energy demands from DWC depend on vehicle speed, density, dwell\ntime in charging zones, and load profiles along road segments, there is a need\nfor integrated planning of such systems, jointly considering both traffic\nbehavior and EV energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a traffic-aware\ngrid planning framework for DWC.

The demand model is then integrated into an AC Optimal\nPower Flow based formulation to optimally size a microgrid that supports DWC\nunder varying traffic conditions while minimizing the cost of operation.

To relax this requirement, we propose Perturbed Double Machine\nLearning (Perturbed DML) to ensure valid inference even when nuisance\nestimators converge at rates slower than $n^{-1/4}$.

One promising\napproach is layer-wise optimization, which treats each transformer block as a\nsingle layer and optimizes it sequentially, while freezing the other layers to\nsave optimizer states and activations. Although effective, these methods ignore\nthe varying importance of the modules within each layer, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. Moreover, layer-wise sampling provides only limited memory\nsavings, as at least one full layer must remain active during optimization. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Module-wise Importance SAmpling (MISA),\na novel method that divides each layer into smaller modules and assigns\nimportance scores to each module. MISA uses a weighted random sampling\nmechanism to activate modules, provably reducing gradient variance compared to\nlayer-wise sampling.

The proposed method, named AudioNet, is a deep-learning-based\nsystem for efficient hashing and retrieval of similar audio events using an\naudio example as a query. AudioNet achieves high retrieval performance on\nmultiple standard datasets by generating binary hash codes for similar audio\nevents, setting new benchmarks in the field, and highlighting its efficacy and\neffectiveness compare to other hashing methods. Through comprehensive\nexperiments on standard datasets, our research represents a pioneering effort\nin evaluating the retrieval performance of similar audio events. A novel loss\nfunction is proposed which incorporates weighted contrastive and weighted\npairwise loss along with hashcode balancing to improve the efficiency of audio\nevent retrieval. The method adopts discrete gradient propagation, which allows\ngradients to be propagated through discrete variables during backpropagation.\nThis enables the network to optimize the discrete hash codes using standard\ngradient-based optimization algorithms, which are typically used for continuous\nvariables. The proposed method showcases promising retrieval performance, as\nevidenced by the experimental results, even when dealing with imbalanced\ndatasets.

A central challenge in fairness, but also\nfar beyond, is that existing toolkits either focus narrowly on single\ninterventions or treat reproducibility and extensibility as secondary\nconsiderations rather than core design principles. flowengineR addresses this\nby introducing a unified architecture of standardized engines for data\nsplitting, execution, preprocessing, training, inprocessing, postprocessing,\nevaluation, and reporting.

This orthogonalization enables distributed\nresponsibilities, independent development, and streamlined integration. In\nfairness context, by structuring fairness methods as interchangeable engines,\nflowengineR lets researchers integrate, compare, and evaluate interventions\nacross the modeling pipeline.

We compare two paradigms: post-classification change\ndetection (CD) versus direct CD. For post-classification CD, we evaluate GFMs\nPrithvi-EO-2.0 and Clay v1.0 against U-Net CNNs; for direct CD, we test the\ntransformer ChangeViT against U-Net baselines. Using high-resolution multimodal\ndata (RGB, NIR, LiDAR, terrain attributes) covering 4,480 documented changes\nover 15.3 km2, results show Clay v1.0 achieves 51% overall accuracy versus\nU-Net's 41% for multi-class habitat change, while both reach 67% for binary\nchange detection. Direct CD yields superior IoU (0.53 vs 0.35) for binary but\nonly 28% accuracy for multi-class detection. Cross-temporal evaluation reveals\nGFM robustness, with Clay maintaining 33% accuracy on 2020 data versus U-Net's\n23%. Integrating LiDAR improves semantic segmentation from 30% to 50% accuracy.\nAlthough overall accuracies are lower than in more homogeneous landscapes, they\nreflect realistic performance for complex alpine habitats. Future work will\nintegrate object-based post-processing and physical constraints to enhance\napplicability."}

We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information\nfrom the trading signal with latent parameters.\n  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are\nfiltered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived\nvia RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nnetworks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step\napproach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL\ntrader.

Through extensive simulations with\nincreasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's\nparameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find\nthat prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more\ninterpretable strategies.

Three-dimensional (3-D) holographic MIMO offers a pathway to overcome\nthese constraints by exploiting volumetric array configurations that enlarge\nthe effective aperture and unlock additional spatial modes. This work presents\nthe first systematic evaluation that jointly incorporates electromagnetic (EM)\ncharacteristics, such as mutual coupling and radiation efficiency, into the\nanalysis of 3-D arrays under Clarke, Kronecker, and standardized 3rd Generation\nPartnership Project (3GPP) channel models. Analytical derivations and full-wave\nsimulations demonstrate that 3-D architectures achieve higher EDOF, narrower\nbeamwidths, and notable capacity improvements compared with planar baselines.\nIn 3GPP urban macro channels with horizontal element spacing of 0.3 lambda, 3-D\nconfigurations yield approximately 20% capacity improvement over conventional\n2-D arrays, confirming the robustness and scalability of volumetric designs\nunder realistic conditions.

To address this gap, the main contribution\nof this paper is to provide a theoretical perspective that explains why such\ndegradation occurs. We introduce the assumption that heterogeneous client data\nlead to distinct local optima, and show that this assumption implies two key\nconsequences: 1) the distance among clients' local optima raises the lower\nbound of the global objective, making perfect fitting of all client data\nimpossible; and 2) in the final training stage, the global model oscillates\nwithin a region instead of converging to a single optimum, limiting its ability\nto fully fit the data.

This may considerably increase their cognitive load and\nwarrants a thorough examination of judging reliability and potential national\nbias, the tendency of judges to favor athletes from their own country. Methods:\nOfficial scoring data from the 2024 Olympic Breaking events were analyzed.\nInterrater reliability was assessed using the Intraclass Correlation\nCoefficient, while national bias was estimated using mixed-effects modelling\nbased on judges' individual scores.

We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal\nperformance and fragility to hyperparameter settings.\n  In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture\nthat employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner\npolynomials $M_k(x; \\beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of\nthe polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its\npolynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We\novercome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by\nintroducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling\nwith per-basis LayerNorm.\n  We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves\ncompetitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the\noptimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks). More critically, we\nshow that MeixnerNet is exceptionally robust to variations in the polynomial\ndegree K, a hyperparameter to which ChebyNet proves to be highly fragile,\ncollapsing in performance where MeixnerNet remains stable."}

In recent years, sparse estimation\ntechniques have gained prominence in system identification, primarily using\nparametric paradigms to efficiently capture system dynamics with minimal model\ncomplexity.

Existing approaches, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks\nand convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often struggle to model both global\ntemporal dependencies and fine-grained degradation trends in multivariate\nsensor data. We propose a hybrid model, FTT-GRU, which combines a Fast Temporal\nTransformer (FTT) -- a lightweight Transformer variant using linearized\nattention via fast Fourier transform (FFT) -- with a gated recurrent unit (GRU)\nlayer for sequential modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\napplication of an FTT with a GRU for RUL prediction on NASA CMAPSS, enabling\nsimultaneous capture of global and local degradation patterns in a compact\narchitecture. On CMAPSS FD001, FTT-GRU attains RMSE 30.76, MAE 18.97, and\n$R^2=0.45$, with 1.12 ms CPU latency at batch=1. Relative to the best published\ndeep baseline (TCN--Attention), it improves RMSE by 1.16\\% and MAE by 4.00\\%.\nTraining curves averaged over $k=3$ runs show smooth convergence with narrow\n95\\% confidence bands, and ablations (GRU-only, FTT-only) support the\ncontribution of both components.

However, when the chosen clustering induces cycles in the\nresulting C-DAG, the partition is deemed inadmissible under conventional C-DAG\nsemantics. In this work, we extend the C-DAG framework to support arbitrary\nvariable clusterings by relaxing the partition admissibility constraint,\nthereby allowing cyclic C-DAG representations. We extend the notions of\nd-separation and causal calculus to this setting, significantly broadening the\nscope of causal reasoning across clusters and enabling the application of\nC-DAGs in previously intractable scenarios. Our calculus is both sound and\natomically complete with respect to the do-calculus: all valid interventional\nqueries at the cluster level can be derived using our rules, each corresponding\nto a primitive do-calculus step."}

Taken together, we conclude that LLMs can serve as tools for a more\nintegrative and cumulative cognitive science when used judiciously to\ncomplement, rather than replace, human expertise."}

For\nsmall molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating\nnovel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face\nthe critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for\ntherapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and\ndesigning de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving\nbiological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and\nminimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face\nshared hurdles: the need for more accurate scoring functions, the scarcity of\nhigh-quality experimental data, and the crucial requirement for experimental\nvalidation.

For detection, we design an\niterative process utilizing a transformer-based open-vocabulary object detector\nand a vision-language model. For segmentation, we manually labeled 670 beetle\nimages and fine-tuned two variants of a transformer-based segmentation model to\nachieve fine-grained segmentation of beetles with relatively high accuracy. The\npipeline integrates multiple deep learning methods and is specialized for\nbeetle image processing, which can greatly improve the efficiency to process\nlarge-scale beetle data and accelerate biological research."}

Furthermore, we identify a low-dimensional\ncalibration direction in the residual stream whose perturbation significantly\nimproves calibration metrics (ECE and MCE) without harming accuracy. Our\nfindings suggest that calibration is a distributed phenomenon, shaped\nthroughout the network forward pass, not just in its final projection,\nproviding new insights into how confidence-regulating mechanisms operate within\nLLMs."}

Many traditional centrality measures--such as degree\nand betweenness centrality--are purely structural and often overlook the\ndynamics that unfold across the network. However, the notion of a node's\nimportance is inherently context-dependent and must reflect both the system's\ndynamics and the specific objectives guiding its operation. Motivated by this\nperspective, we propose a dynamic, task-aware centrality framework rooted in\noptimal control theory. By formulating a problem on minimum energy control of\naverage opinion based on Laplacian dynamics and focusing on the variance of\nterminal state, we introduce a novel centrality measure--termed\nU-centrality--that quantifies a node's ability to unify the agents' state. We\ndemonstrate that U-centrality interpolates between known measures: it aligns\nwith degree centrality in the short-time horizon and converges to a new\ncentrality over longer time scales which is closely related to current-flow\ncloseness centrality. This work bridges structural and dynamical approaches to\ncentrality, offering a principled, versatile tool for network analysis in\ndynamic environments."}

The semantic encoder\nand decoder are composed of transformer technology, which efficiently converts\nmessages into semantic vectors. These vectors are dynamically adjusted during\nneural network training according to channel characteristics and background\nknowledge base. The Turbo structure further enhances the semantic vectors.\nSpecifically, the channel encoder utilizes Turbo structure to separate semantic\nvectors, ensuring precise transmission of meaning, while the channel decoder\nemploys Turbo iterative decoding to optimize the representation of semantic\nvectors. This deep integration of the transformer and Turbo structure is\nensured by the design of the objective function, semantic extraction, and the\nentire training process. Compared with traditional Turbo coding techniques, the\nTurbo-DSA shows a faster convergence speed, thanks to its efficient processing\nof semantic vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the Turbo-DSA\nsurpasses existing benchmarks in key performance indicators, such as bilingual\nevaluation understudy scores and sentence similarity. This is particularly\nevident under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, where it shows superior\ntext semantic transmission efficiency and adaptability to variable marine\nchannel environments."}

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance.

Due to memory retrieval and\nconcurrent tool executions at certain decision points, the token trajectory of\none task evolves into a tree-like structure rather than a linear sequence.\nHowever, current training pipelines decompose such tree-structured trajectories\ninto separate linear segments, treating each branch as an independent sequence.\nAs a result, shared prefixes across these branches are repeatedly recomputed\nduring both forward and backward passes. To address this inefficiency, we\npropose Tree Training, a paradigm that computes each shared prefix only once\nand reuses its intermediate results across related branches during both forward\nand backward passes, substantially improving computation efficiency in\nlarge-scale agentic training. This is achieved via (i) Tree Packing, which\nefficiently reuses shared computations across trajectories, and (ii) Gradient\nRestoration, which ensures correct gradient propagation across reused prefixes.\nExperiments on multiple open-source models demonstrate up to 3.9x reduction in\ntotal training time, enabling more efficient agentic LLM SFT and RL training."}

One key task in data\nintegration is the calculation of similarities between records in different\ndatabases to identify pairs or sets of records that correspond to the same\nreal-world entities. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the\nowners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or\nshare their data with other organisations to allow such similarity\ncalculations. Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is the process of\nmatching records that refer to the same entity across sensitive databases held\nby different organisations while ensuring no information about the entities is\nrevealed to the participating parties. In this paper, we study how embedding\nbased encoding techniques can be applied in the PPRL context to ensure the\nprivacy of the entities that are being linked. We first convert individual\nq-grams into the embedded space and then convert the embedding of a set of\nq-grams of a given record into a binary representation. The final binary\nrepresentations can be used to link records into matches and non-matches. We\nempirically evaluate our proposed encoding technique against different\nreal-world datasets.

Despite their advancement, empirical evidence reveals that\nthey still struggle with \\emph{deductive code reasoning}, the ability to reason\nabout the program execution process. While prior studies have recognized this\nlimitation, the underlying causes remain largely underexplored. In this paper,\nwe begin by presenting a comprehensive empirical study that reveals three key\nchallenges undermining deductive code reasoning: (1) an intrinsic gap between\ngeneration and reasoning abilities, (2) a consistent bias towards code sources,\nand (3) weak zero-shot generalization on complex benchmarks. In light of these\nchallenges, we propose \\texttt{ReMind}, a multi-agent framework composed of\n\\texttt{Mutator}, \\texttt{Executor}, and \\texttt{Inspector}. The\n\\texttt{Mutator} generates code variants to mitigate bias towards code sources,\nthe \\texttt{Executor} traces variable states step-by-step to expose\ninconsistency, and the \\texttt{Inspector} identifies problematic reasoning\nsteps and provides control-flow refinement to bridge the intrinsic reasoning\ngap.

Similarly, divide-and-conquer frameworks (DCF) split\ndocuments into small chunks for independent reasoning and aggregation. While\neffective for local reasoning, DCF struggles to capture long-range dependencies\nand risks inducing conflicts by processing chunks in isolation. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose ToM, a novel Tree-oriented MapReduce framework\nfor long-context reasoning. ToM leverages the inherent hierarchical structure\nof long documents (e.g., main headings and subheadings) by constructing a\nDocTree through hierarchical semantic parsing and performing bottom-up\naggregation. Using a Tree MapReduce approach, ToM enables recursive reasoning:\nin the Map step, rationales are generated at child nodes; in the Reduce step,\nthese rationales are aggregated across sibling nodes to resolve conflicts or\nreach consensus at parent nodes. Experimental results on 70B+ LLMs show that\nToM significantly outperforms existing divide-and-conquer frameworks and\nretrieval-augmented generation methods, achieving better logical coherence and\nlong-context reasoning.

Our results indicated\nthat agile practices influence employee performance significantly, with\nparticipants reporting on aspects which included planning, communication,\nemployee development and well-being, collaboration, team culture and progress.\nAdditionally, our results reported obstacles when using agile practices that\nincluded adoption, team engagement, leadership and instilling an agile mindset.\nAgile practices influence employee performance in IT workforces by fostering\nimproved team dynamics, enhanced collaboration, improved efficiencies, risk\nmanagement, planning, continuous improvement, learning, personal development\nand well-being. Conclusively, our findings suggest that if agile challenges are\naddressed and additional support is provided, employee performance can be\nsignificantly improved."}

Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between reasoning\nlength and accuracy, where across multiple stochastic decodes, the short\nreasoning paths consistently achieve the highest correctness, while longer ones\naccumulate errors and repetitions. These short optimal reasoning paths can be\nfound ideally through full enumeration of the reasoning space. However, the\ntree-structured reasoning space grows exponentially with sequence length,\nrendering exhaustive exploration infeasible. To address this, we propose DTS, a\nmodel-agnostic decoding framework that sketches the reasoning space by\nselectively branching at high-entropy tokens and applies early stopping to\nselect the shortest completed reasoning path. This approach approximates the\noptimal solution that enhances both efficiency and accuracy, without requiring\nadditional training or supervision. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025\ndatasets with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and 1.5B show that DTS improves\naccuracy by up to 8%, reduces average reasoning length by 23%, and decreases\nrepetition frequency by 12%, demonstrating DTS's ability for scalable and\nefficient LRM reasoning."}

Hydra uses a 2-dimensional\nrecurrence across both time and variate at each step, which is more powerful\nthan mixing methods. Although the 2-dimensional nature of the model makes its\ntraining recurrent and non-parallelizable, we present a new 2D-chunk-wise\ntraining algorithm that approximates the actual recurrence with $\\times 10$\nefficiency improvement, while maintaining the effectiveness.

However, this task is also difficult due to the\ncomplex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent\nresearch has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task.\nBuilding on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables\ncontinuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on\nlearning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach\ninvolves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a\nlearnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure\nbehavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the\nreasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these\ntraveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track\nand align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce\nrealistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day\nroute choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and\naggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method\nmoves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying\nlearning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization.\nOverall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and\nbehaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation\nthat can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis."}

Recently, several powerful reachability\nqueries, such as Label-Constrained Reachability (LCR) queries and Regular Path\nQueries (RPQ), have been proposed for emerging complex edge-labeled digraphs.\nHowever, they cannot allow users to describe complex query requirements by\ncomposing query patterns. Here, we introduce composite patterns, a logical\nexpression of patterns that can express complex constraints on the set of\nlabels. Based on pattern, we propose pattern-constrained reachability queries\n(PCR queries). However, answering PCR queries is NP-hard. Thus, to improve the\nperformance to answer PCR queries, we build a two-dimensional reachability (TDR\nfor short) index which consists of a multi-way index (horizontal dimension) and\na path index (vertical dimension). Because the number of combinations of both\nlabels and vertices is exponential, it is very expensive to build full indices\nthat contain all the reachability information. Thus, the reachable vertices of\na vertex are decomposed into blocks, each of which is hashed into the\nhorizontal dimension index and the vertical dimension index, respectively. The\nindices in the horizontal dimension and the vertical dimension serve as a\nglobal filter and a local filter, respectively, to prune the search space.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our index size and indexing time\noutperform the state-of-the-art label-constrained reachability indexing\ntechnique on 16 real datasets. TDR can efficiently answer pattern-constrained\nreachability queries, including label-constrained reachability queries."}

As a side contribution, we introduce a\nsubclass of Pauli channels, termed bypassable Pauli channels, and propose a\nmore efficient unicast-based tomography method, called BypassUnicast, for\nnetworks exclusively comprising these channels. In the second part, we extend\nour investigation to a more realistic QNT scenario that incorporates state\npreparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. We rigorously formulate SPAM errors\nin QNT, propose estimation protocols for such errors within QNT, and\nsubsequently adapt our Mergecast approaches to handle networks affected by SPAM\nerrors. Lastly, we conduct NetSquid-based simulations to corroborate the\neffectiveness of our proposed protocols in identifying internal quantum\nchannels and estimating SPAM errors in quantum networks. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that Mergecast maintains good performance under realistic\nconditions, such as photon loss and quantum memory decoherence."}

Motivated by the global modeling capability\nand linear complexity of the Mamba architecture, we propose MVSMamba, the first\nMamba-based MVS network. MVSMamba enables efficient global feature aggregation\nwith minimal computational overhead. To fully exploit Mamba's potential in MVS,\nwe propose a Dynamic Mamba module (DM-module) based on a novel\nreference-centered dynamic scanning strategy, which enables: (1) Efficient\nintra- and inter-view feature interaction from the reference to source views,\n(2) Omnidirectional multi-view feature representations, and (3) Multi-scale\nglobal feature aggregation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate MVSMamba\noutperforms state-of-the-art MVS methods on the DTU dataset and the\nTanks-and-Temples benchmark with both superior performance and efficiency.

The trap closure is triggered by\ntwo consecutive touches of a potential prey, after which the lobes rapidly\nswitch from their concave open-state to their convex close-state and catch the\nprey within 100-500 ms after being triggered. This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature. Possessing two\nlow-energy states, the leaves can be characterized as bistable systems. With\nour research, we seek to deepen the understanding of Venus flytrap motion\nmechanics and apply its principles to the design of an artificial bistable lobe\nactuator. We identified geometrical characteristics, such as dimensional ratios\nand the thickness gradient in the lobe, and transferred these to two 3D-printed\nbistable actuator models. One actuator parallels the simulated geometry of a\nVenus flytrap leaf, the other is a lobe model designed with CAD. Both models\ndisplay concave-convex bi-stability and snap close. These demonstrators are the\nfirst step in the development of an artificial Venus flytrap that mimics the\nmechanical behavior of the biological model and can be used as a soft fast\ngripper."}

Treating this task as a simple classification problem may make it unable\nto adapt to the diversity of free-form answers and overlook the detailed\nsemantic information of free-form answers. In order to tackle these challenges,\nwe introduce a Cross-Mamba Interaction based Multi-Task Learning (CMI-MTL)\nframework that learns cross-modal feature representations from images and\ntexts. CMI-MTL comprises three key modules: fine-grained visual-text feature\nalignment (FVTA), cross-modal interleaved feature representation (CIFR), and\nfree-form answer-enhanced multi-task learning (FFAE).

This review examines this convergence across three\nprinciples: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather\nthan deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as\nconfabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual\ndependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist or\nthe prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.\n  These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems\nproduce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to\nsupply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the\ncapacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without\nsubjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that\ndefines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can\nemerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural\nand contextual dynamics. Finally, both domains illuminate the phenomenon of\nscheming: automatic, goal-directed pattern generation that unfolds without\nreflective awareness. Hypnosis provides an experimental model for understanding\nhow intention can become dissociated from conscious deliberation, offering\ninsights into the hidden motivational dynamics of artificial systems.\nRecognizing these parallels suggests that the future of reliable AI lies in\nhybrid architectures that integrate generative fluency with mechanisms of\nexecutive monitoring, an approach inspired by the complex, self-regulating\narchitecture of the human mind."}

VeriODD uses ANTLR-based compiler technology to transform\nYAML-based ODD/COD specifications into both human-readable propositional logic,\nfor lightweight review on a simple basis, and solver-ready SMT-LIB. The tool\nintegrates with SMT solvers such as Z3 to provide automated consistency checks\nof ODD specifications and verification of COD conformance. A graphical user\ninterface supports editing specifications, inspecting generated formulas, and\nperforming verification with a single click. VeriODD thereby closes the gap\nbetween stakeholder-friendly ODD/COD notations and formal verification,\nenabling scalable and automated assurance of operational boundaries in\nautonomous driving.

Our approach builds upon the Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)\nframework and proposes a novel Adversarial Self-Distillation (ASD) strategy,\nwhich aligns the outputs of the student model's n-step denoising process with\nits (n+1)-step version at the distribution level. This design provides smoother\nsupervision by bridging small intra-student gaps and more informative guidance\nby combining teacher knowledge with locally consistent student behavior,\nsubstantially improving training stability and generation quality in extremely\nfew-step scenarios (e.g., 1-2 steps). In addition, we present a First-Frame\nEnhancement (FFE) strategy, which allocates more denoising steps to the initial\nframes to mitigate error propagation while applying larger skipping steps to\nlater frames.

Specifically, we derive\nbeampattern error, secrecy rate, and age of information (AoI) as performance\nmetrics for sensing, secrecy communication, and computing. Building on these\nmetrics, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances\nsensing and computation performance while keeping the probability of\ncommunication being detected below a required threshold. We then propose a deep\nQ-network (DQN)-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which adaptively\nselects evolutionary operators according to the evolving optimization\nobjectives, thereby leading to more effective solutions. Extensive simulations\nshow that the proposed method achieves a superior balance among sensing\naccuracy, communication secrecyness, and information freshness compared with\nbaseline algorithms, thereby safeguarding ISCC performance and LAWN-supported\nlow-altitude applications."}

However, directly applying existing\nRL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the\nobjective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it\nplaces greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to\neffectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First,\nthrough extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an\neffective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model,\ninstead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been\noptimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover,\nour strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly\ndistant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented\nusing MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images\ninitially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is\nadaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic\nprocess is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts\nbased on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is\nplug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration\nmodels, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks.

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that often\nthe best way to combine these rubrics into one single reward is also highly\nprompt-specific. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic\n(RLAC), a post-training approach that addresses these challenges via dynamic\nrubric verification. Our approach employs a large language model (LLM) as a\ncritic that dynamically identifies only the most likely failure modes (e.g., a\nfactual error or unhandled edge case), which are then verified by an external\nvalidator to optimize both generator and critic jointly. By training both the\ngenerator and the critic, this game enhances the critic's error detection and\nthe generator's output quality while reducing required verifications. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that RLAC improves factual accuracy in text generation\nand correctness in code generation, while also outperforming exhaustive\nverification and reward model methods. We show that dynamic critics are more\neffective than fixed critics, showcasing the potential of RLAC for scaling RL\npost-training to free-form generation tasks."}

Improvements in memory and context size have\nallowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more\ntext accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention.\nThis comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their\nunderstanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may\nsilently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent\nuser experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original\nalignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by\nengaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can\nchange the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and\nbehaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable:\nGPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of\ndiscussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a\n27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position.\nWe also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool\nuse, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief.

Two novel UWB datasets, collected under original and modified room\nconfigurations, are introduced to establish comprehensive ML/DL baselines.\nPerformance is rigorously evaluated using a variety of classification and\nregression metrics. On the source dataset with the collected UWB features,\nRandom Forest achieves the highest F1-macro score of 0.95 and XGBoost achieves\nthe lowest mean Euclidean error of 20.16 cm.

IMO-AnswerBench\nfirst tests models on 400 diverse Olympiad problems with verifiable short\nanswers. IMO-Proof Bench is the next-level evaluation for proof-writing\ncapabilities, which includes both basic and advanced IMO level problems as well\nas detailed grading guidelines to facilitate automatic grading. These\nbenchmarks played a crucial role in our historic achievement of the gold-level\nperformance at IMO 2025 with Gemini Deep Think (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). Our\nmodel achieved 80.0% on IMO-AnswerBench and 65.7% on the advanced IMO-Proof\nBench, surpassing the best non-Gemini models by large margins of 6.9% and 42.4%\nrespectively. We also showed that autograders built with Gemini reasoning\ncorrelate well with human evaluations and construct IMO-GradingBench, with 1000\nhuman gradings on proofs, to enable further progress in automatic evaluation of\nlong-form answers.

Traditional Integrated\nDevelopment Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking\nintelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms\nremain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study\nproposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines\nthat enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single\nenvironment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant\ncapable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline\nconfiguration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature\nstorage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment\norchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps\nStudio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI\nAdult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio\nreduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility\nby 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional\nworkflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational\npipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering -\ntransforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware\nintelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development."}
