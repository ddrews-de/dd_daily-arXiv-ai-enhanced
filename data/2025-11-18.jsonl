While methods based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) can provide tight bounds, they suffer from model uncertainty due to the need to decide where the upper tail of the distribution begins. Conversely, inequality-based approaches avoid this issue but can yield pessimistic results for heavy-tailed distributions. This paper proposes a method to reduce such pessimism by incorporating saturating functions (arctangent and hyperbolic tangent) into Chebyshev's inequality, which mitigates the influence of large outliers while preserving mathematical soundness. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world data from the Autoware autonomous driving stack demonstrate that the proposed method achieves safe and tighter bounds for such distributions."}

In this work, we present a novel framework for parameter inference in PDifMPs based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide detailed simulation algorithms for PDifMP sample paths. Second, we extend existing ABC summary statistics for diffusion processes to account for the hybrid nature of PDifMPs, showing particular effectiveness for ergodic systems. Third, we demonstrate our approach on several representative example PDifMPs that empirically exhibit ergodic behaviour. Our results show that the proposed ABC method reliably recovers model parameters across all examples, even in challenging scenarios where only partial information on jumps and diffusion is available or when parameters appear in state-dependent jump rate functions. These findings highlight the potential of ABC as a practical tool for inference in various complex stochastic hybrid systems."}

Recently, frequency-domain methods have attracted increasing interest for their ability to capture global dependencies. However, when applied to non-stationary time series, these methods encounter the $\\textit{spectral entanglement}$ and the computational burden of complex-valued learning. The $\\textit{spectral entanglement}$ refers to the overlap of trends, periodicities, and noise across the spectrum due to $\\textit{spectral leakage}$ and the presence of non-stationarity. However, existing decompositions are not suited to resolving spectral entanglement. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Network (FreDN), which introduces a learnable Frequency Disentangler module to separate trend and periodic components directly in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we propose a theoretically supported ReIm Block to reduce the complexity of complex-valued operations while maintaining performance. We also re-examine the frequency-domain loss function and provide new theoretical insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on seven long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that FreDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10\\%. Furthermore, compared with standard complex-valued architectures, our real-imaginary shared-parameter design reduces the parameter count and computational cost by at least 50\\%."}

Source apportionment using least squares-based non-negative matrix factorization is non-unique and often does not scale. A recent geometric source apportionment framework focuses inference on the source attribution matrix, which is shown to remain identifiable even when the factorization is not. Recognizing that the method scales with and benefits from large data volumes, we use this geometric method to analyze 451,946 one-minute air sensor records from Curtis Bay (Baltimore, USA), collected from October 21, 2022 to June 16, 2023, covering size-resolved particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The analysis identifies three stable sources. Source 1 explains > 70% of fine and coarse PM and ~30% of BC. Source 2 dominates CO and contributes ~70% of BC, NO, and NO2. Source 3 is specific to the larger PM fractions, PM10 to PM40. Regression analyses show Source 1 and Source 3 rise during bulldozer activity at a nearby coal terminal and under winds from the terminal, indicating a direct coal terminal influence, while Source 2 exhibits diurnal patterns consistent with traffic. A case-study on the day with a known bulldozer incident at the coal terminal further confirms the association of terminal activities with Sources 1 and 3. The results are stable under sensitivity analyses. The analysis demonstrates that geometric source apportionment, paired with high temporal resolution data from multi-pollutant air sensor networks, delivers scalable and reliable evidence to inform mitigation strategies."}

For this purpose, the paper analyzes the main stages of the JPEG compression algorithm, notes its key features and problems that limit further enhancement of its efficiency. To overcome these limitations, it is proposed to use the real version of the two-dimensional discrete orthogonal Weyl-Heisenberg transform (DWHT) instead of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the stage of transformation coding. This transformation, unlike DCT, initially has a block structure and is built on the basis of the Weyl-Heisenberg optimal signal basis, the functions of which are orthogonal and well localized both in the frequency and time domains. This feature of DWHT allows for more efficient decorrelation and compression of element values in each block of the image after transformation coding. As a result, it is possible to obtain more efficient selection and screening of insignificant elements at the subsequent stages of quantization and information coding. Based on DWHT, a new version of the JPEG compression algorithm was developed, and convenient criteria for evaluating the compression efficiency and metrics of quality losses were proposed. The results of an experimental study are presented, confirming the higher compression efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the JPEG compression standard."}

Bias-shift invariance appears as Reeb flow on the screen, and the Fenchel-Young equality/KL gap provides a computable distance to the seam.

The solution is given in terms of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) where a LLM \"teacher\" trains a smaller and more efficient \"student\" model, offers a promising solution to this problem. However, the distillation process itself often remains costly for large datasets, since it requires the teacher to label a vast number of samples while incurring significant token consumption. To alleviate this challenge, in this work we explore the active learning (AL) as a way to create efficient student models at a fraction of the cost while preserving the LLM's performance. In particular, we introduce M-RARU (Multi-class Randomized Accept/Reject Uncertainty Sampling), a novel AL algorithm that significantly reduces training costs. M-RARU employs an innovative strategy combining uncertainty with a randomized accept-reject mechanism to select only the most informative data points for the LLM teacher. This focused approach significantly minimizes required API calls and data processing time. We evaluate M-RARU against random sampling across five diverse student models (SVM, LDA, RF, GBDT, and DistilBERT) on multiple benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 80% reduction in sample requirements as compared to random sampling, substantially improving classification accuracy while reducing financial costs and overall training time."}

In parallel, we use Gaussian-process Bayesian optimization to tune penalized Cox survival models on the GBSG2 breast cancer cohort. This yields a two-layer system: a Bayesian predictive layer that represents risk as a posterior distribution, and a Bayesian optimization layer that treats model selection as inference over a black-box objective.\n  Simulation studies in low- and high-dimensional regimes show that the Bayesian layer provides reliable coverage and improved calibration, while Bayesian shrinkage improves AUC, Brier score, and log-loss. Bayesian optimization consistently pushes survival models toward near-oracle concordance.

The increasing popularity of algorithmic decision-making has stimulated interest in algorithmic fairness within the academic community. Researchers have introduced various fairness definitions that quantify disparities between privileged and protected groups, use causal inference to determine the impact of race on model predictions, and that test calibration of probability predictions from the model. Existing literature does not provide a way in which to assess whether observed disparities between groups are statistically significant or merely due to chance. This paper introduces a rigorous framework for testing the statistical significance of fairness violations by leveraging k-fold cross-validation [2] to generate sampling distributions of fairness metrics. This paper introduces statistical tests that can be used to identify statistically significant violations of fairness metrics based on disparities between predicted and actual outcomes, model calibration, and causal inference techniques [1]. We demonstrate this approach by testing recidivism forecasting algorithms trained on data from the National Institute of Justice. Our findings reveal that machine learning algorithms used for recidivism forecasting exhibit statistically significant bias against Black individuals under several fairness definitions, while also exhibiting no bias or bias against White individuals under other definitions. The results from this paper underscore the importance of rigorous and robust statistical testing while evaluating algorithmic decision-making systems."}

Persistent homology has seen broad use across domains such as computer vision and neuroscience. Most statistical treatments, however, use homology primarily as a feature extractor, relying on statistical distance-based tests or simple time-to-event models for inferential tasks. While these approaches can detect global differences, they rarely localize the source of those differences. We address this gap by taking a graphical model-based approach: we associate each vertex with a population latent position in a conic space and model each bar's key events (birth and death times) using an exponential distribution, whose rate is a transformation of the latent positions according to an event occurring on the graph. The low-dimensional bars have simple graph-event representations, such as the formation of a minimum spanning tree or the triangulation of a loop, and thus enjoy tractable likelihoods. Taking a Bayesian approach, we infer latent positions and enable model extensions such as hierarchical models that allow borrowing strength across groups. Applications to a neuroimaging study of Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that our method localizes sources of difference and provides interpretable, model-based analyses of topological structure in complex data.

Indeed, neuromorphic engineering could provide low-latency, low-energy and adaptive control systems in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) exploiting spike-based control and communication. However, systematic methods for designing and analyzing neuron-inspired spiking controllers are currently lacking. This paper presents a new systematic approach for stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using SNN-based controllers, designed as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, whose input is the measured output from the plant and generating spiking control signals. The new approach consists of a two-step emulation-based design procedure. In the first step, we establish conditions on the neuron parameters to ensure that the spiking signal generated by a pair of neurons emulates any continuous-time signal input to the neurons with arbitrary accuracy in terms of a special metric for spiky signals. In the second step, we propose a novel stability notion, called integral spiking-input-to-state stability (iSISS) building on this special metric. We prove that an asymptotically stable LTI system has this iSISS property. By combining these steps, a certifiable practical stability property of the closed-loop system can be established. Generalizations are discussed and the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in a numerical case study."}

However, these approaches are often computationally expensive due to their heavy reliance on resampling procedures and tend to produce overly conservative prediction sets with unstable coverage, especially in small samples. To address these challenges, MMDCP combines class-specific distance measures with full conformal prediction to construct a score function, thereby producing adaptive prediction sets that effectively capture both inlier and outlier structures. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish convergence rates for the resulting sets and provide the first theoretical characterization of the gap between oracle and empirical conformal $p$-values, which ensures valid coverage and effective control of the class-wise false discovery rate (CW-FDR).

Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, such as High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively guarantee safety in continuous time but may become unsafe when executed under zero-order-hold (ZOH) controllers due to inter-sampling effects. Moreover, they do not explicitly handle finite-time reach-and-remain requirements or multiple simultaneous constraints, which often lead to conflicts between safety and reach-and-remain objectives, resulting in feasibility issues during control synthesis. This paper introduces Sampling-Aware Control Barrier Functions (SACBFs), a unified framework that accounts for sampling effects and high relative-degree constraints by estimating and incorporating Taylor-based upper bounds on barrier evolution between sampling instants. The proposed method guarantees continuous-time forward invariance of safety and finite-time reach-and-remain sets under ZOH control.

We evaluated our framework using 5-fold cross-validation on a clinical dataset of 349 images, where it achieved a high F1-score of 0.852 for predicting malignancy. To validate its performance, we compared it against a strong baseline using a Random Forest classifier with hand-crafted morphological features, which achieved an F1-score of 0.829. The superior performance of our DL framework suggests that the implicit visual features learned from the localised nodule are more predictive than explicit shape features alone. This is the first fully automated end-to-end pipeline for both detecting thyroid nodules on ultrasound images and predicting their malignancy."}

Consequently, trust evaluation of potential collaborators based on these multifaceted attributes becomes critical for ensuring the eventual outcome. However, due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of physical and social attributes, efficiently integrating them for accurate trust evaluation remains challenging. To overcome this difficulty, a canonical correlation analysis-enhanced hypergraph self-supervised learning (HSLCCA) method is proposed in this research. First, by treating all attributes as relationships among connected devices, a relationship hypergraph is constructed to comprehensively capture inter-device relationships across three dimensions: spatial attribute-related, device attribute-related, and social attribute-related. Next, a self-supervised learning framework is developed to integrate these multi-dimensional relationships and generate device embeddings enriched with relational semantics. In this learning framework, the relationship hypergraph is augmented into two distinct views to enhance semantic information. A parameter-sharing hypergraph neural network is then utilized to learn device embeddings from both views. To further enhance embedding quality, a CCA approach is applied, allowing the comparison of data between the two views. Finally, the trustworthiness of devices is calculated based on the learned device embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSLCCA method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithm in effectively identifying trusted devices."}

Three samples were considered : a full sample combin- ing both regions and two separate subsamples for West and Central Africa. The results indicate that gender, educational attainment, income level, and place of residence are significant factors influencing both financial and digital inclusion in the full sample and the West African subsam- ple. In the Central African subsample, gender is not significant; however, age, education, income, and rural residence emerge as key determinants of financial and digital inclusion. Overall, Ghana stands out as the most financially inclusive country, although it trails Senegal in terms of credit access and digital payment use. Nigeria leads in formal account ownership and formal savings but falls considerably behind Ghana in mobile money account ownership and digital payments. Central African countries generally report lower levels of inclusion compared to West Africa, with Cameroon performing comparatively better."}

In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior."}

But these conditions are often difficult to prove directly. For simple linear rank statistics, however, it is possible to use a result from van Zwet (1982) to verify these assumptions.

Despite the severity of this problem, more comprehensive quantitative scientific studies need to be conducted to elucidate the sequence and dynamics of these occurrences. In response, this study introduces a spatio-temporal statistical method designed to uncover the patterns of fatalities associated with violent events in Ethiopia. The research employs a two-part zero-inflated Bayesian generalized additive mixed model, which integrates a spatio-temporal component to map the fatality patterns across Ethiopian regions. The dataset utilized originates from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, covering fatality counts related to violent events from 1997 to 2022. The analysis revealed that nine out of thirteen administrative regions exhibited a probability greater than 0.6 for fatality occurrence due to violent events, with five regions surpassing a 0.7 probability threshold. These five regions include Benishangul Gumz, Gambela, Oromia, Somali, and the South West Ethiopian People's Region. Notably, the Tigray region displayed the highest probability (0.558) of experiencing more than 20 deaths per violent event, followed by the Benishangul Gumz region with a probability of 0.306. Encouragingly, the findings also indicate an average decline in fatalities per violent event over time. Specifically, the probability of more than 20 deaths per event was 0.401 in 2020, which decreased to 0.148 by 2022. These insights are invaluable for the government, policymakers, political leaders, and traditional or religious authorities in Ethiopia, enabling them to make informed, strategic decisions to mitigate and ultimately prevent violence-related fatalities in the country."}

However, the literature on various stochastic modeling approaches for assessing coral bleaching is extremely scarce. Data-driven strategies are crucial for effective reef management, and this review article provides an overview of existing statistical and machine learning methods for assessing coral bleaching. Statistical frameworks, including simple regression models, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, Bayesian regression models, spatiotemporal models, and resilience indicators, such as Fisher's Information and Variance Index, are commonly used to explore how different environmental stressors influence coral bleaching.

First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced.

The design is constrained by per-antenna power limits at the TRIS transceiver and by the minimum harvested energy demand of all EH users. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and the energy harvesting constraint, the sum-rate problem is difficult to tackle.

To address the challenges posed by the Poisson likelihood -- such as non-Lipschitz gradients and positivity constraints -- we derive a Bayesian model which leverages exact and asymptotically exact data augmentations. In particular, the augmented model incorporates two sets of splitting variables both derived through a Bregman divergence based on the Burg entropy. Interestingly the resulting augmented posterior distribution is characterized by conditional distributions which benefit from natural conjugacy properties and preserve the intrinsic geometry of the latent and splitting variables. This allows for efficient sampling via Gibbs steps, which can be performed explicitly for all conditionals, except the one incorporating the regularization potential. For this latter, we resort to a Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo (HRLMC) algorithm which is well suited to handle priors with explicit or easily computable score functions. By operating on a mirror manifold, this Langevin step ensures that the sampling satisfies the positivity constraints and more accurately reflects the underlying problem structure.

In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure."}

First, a low-cost, portable hardware prototype that performs real-time audio analysis, mapping distinct frequency bands (sub-bass, bass, mid-range, treble) to a four-channel vibrotactile system, allowing users to feel the music's rhythmic and foundational structure.

Submitted to the IJAC Special Issue \"Rebalance and Reciprocity\"", "summary": "Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture."}

However, most existing methods assume the absence of latent confounders and restrict the underlying causal graph to be acyclic, assumptions that are often violated in many real-world applications. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel framework for causal discovery that accommodates both cycles and latent confounders. By leveraging the identifiability results from noisy independent component analysis and recent advances in factor analysis, we establish the unique causal identifiability under mild conditions. Building on this foundation, we further develop a fully Bayesian approach for causal structure learning, called BayCausal, and evaluate its identifiability, utility, and superior performance against state-of-the-art alternatives through extensive simulation studies. Application to a dataset from the Women's Interagency HIV Study yields interpretable and clinically meaningful insights. To facilitate broader applications, we have implemented BayCausal in an R package, BayCausal, which is the first publicly available software capable of achieving unique causal identification in the presence of both cycles and latent confounders."}

We present sequential phase linking approach using compressed single-look-complex images (SLCs) capable of producing surface displacement estimates within hours of the time of a new acquisition. Our key algorithmic contribution is a mini-stack reference scheme that maintains phase consistency across processing batches without adjusting or re-estimating previous time steps, enabling straightforward operational deployment. We introduce online methods for persistent and distributed scatterer identification that adapt to temporal changes in surface properties through incremental amplitude statistics updates. The processing chain incorporates multiple complementary metrics for pixel quality that are reliable for small SLC stack sizes, and an L1-norm network inversion to limit propagation of unwrapping errors across the time series. We use our algorithm to produce OPERA Surface Displacement from Sentinel-1 product, the first continental-scale surface displacement product over North America. Validation against GPS measurements and InSAR residual analysis demonstrates millimeter-level agreement in velocity estimates in varying environmental conditions. We demonstrate our algorithm's capabilities with a successful recovery of meter-scale co-eruptive displacement at Kilauea volcano during the 2018 eruption, as well as detection of subtle uplift at Three Sisters volcano, Oregon- a challenging environment for C-band InSAR due to dense vegetation and seasonal snow.

Further, they do not leverage the relationships among the study variables in the two files to help determine the linkages. We propose a multiple imputation framework to address these shortcomings. First, we use a bipartite Bayesian record linkage model to generate multiple plausible linked datasets, disregarding the information in the study variables. Second, we presume each linked file has a mixture of true links and false links. We estimate the mixture model using information from the study variables. Through simulation studies under a regression setting, we demonstrate that estimates of the regression model parameters can be more accurate than those based on an analogous two-stage approach. We illustrate the integrated approach using data from the Survey on Household Income and Wealth, examining a regression involving the persistence of income."}

However, there is an inherent trade-off between assessment speed and diagnostic depth-specifically, between rapid overall health estimation and precise identification of internal degradation states. Capturing detailed internal battery information efficiently remains a major challenge, yet such insights are key to understanding the various degradation mechanisms. To address this, we develop a parameterized physics-informed neural network (P-PINNSPM) over the key aging-related parameter space for a single particle model. The model can accurately predict internal battery variables across the parameter space and identifies internal parameters in about 30 seconds-achieving a 47x speedup over the finite volume method-while maintaining high accuracy. These parameters improve the battery state-of-health (SOH) estimation accuracy by at least 60.61%, compared to models without parameter incorporation. Moreover, they enable extrapolation to unseen SOH levels and support robust estimation across diverse charging profiles and operating conditions. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of physics-informed machine learning to advance real-time, data-efficient, and physics-aware battery management systems."}

This paper proposes an Explainability-Enabled Clinical Safety Framework (ECSF) that integrates explainability into the DCB0129/0160 lifecycle, enabling Clinical Safety Officers to use interpretability outputs as structured safety evidence without altering compliance pathways. A cross-regulatory synthesis mapped DCB clauses to principles from Good Machine Learning Practice, the NHS AI Assurance and T.E.S.T. frameworks, and the EU AI Act. The resulting matrix links regulatory clauses, principles, ECSF checkpoints, and suitable explainability outputs. ECSF introduces five checkpoints: global transparency for hazard identification, case-level interpretability for verification, clinician usability for evaluation, traceable decision pathways for risk control, and longitudinal interpretability monitoring for post-market surveillance. Techniques such as SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, saliency mapping, and attention visualisation are mapped to corresponding DCB artefacts. ECSF reframes explainability as a core element of clinical-safety assurance, bridging deterministic risk governance with the probabilistic behaviour of AI and supporting alignment with GMLP, the EU AI Act, and NHS AI Assurance principles."}

Here we introduce MVMR-PACS, a method that identifies signal-groups -- sets of causal risk factors with high genetic correlation or indistinguishable causal effects -- and estimates the direct effect of each group. MVMR-PACS minimizes a debiased objective function that reduces weak instrument bias while yielding interpretable estimates with theoretical guarantees for variable selection. We adapt a data-thinning strategy to summary-data MVMR to enable valid post-selection inference. In simulations, MVMR-PACS outperforms existing approaches in both estimation accuracy and variable selection.

We introduce a weighted bootstrapping approach that prioritizes more reliable trials to generate higher-quality augmented samples. In a Sentence Evaluation paradigm, weights were computed from relative ERP differences and applied during probabilistic sampling and averaging. Across conditions, weighted bootstrapping improved decoding accuracy relative to unweighted (from 68.35% to 71.25% at best), demonstrating that emphasizing reliable trials strengthens representational quality.

We develop a practical dual wideband THz channel model that incorporates absorption losses, reflection losses, diffused ray modeling and angles of arrival/departure (AoAs/AoDs) using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Furthermore, a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is employed at each RF chain, which is crucial for wideband THz massive MIMO systems to reduce power consumption and hardware complexity, given the high sampling rates and large number of antennas involved. The quantized MU THz MIMO model is linearized using the popular Bussgang decomposition followed by BGSR based channel learning framework that results in sparsity across different subcarriers, where each subcarrier has its unique dictionary matrix. Next, the Bayesian Cramér Rao Bound (BCRB) is devised for bounding the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance.

However, two bottlenecks still limit further performance improvement: (1) non-stationary Q-value estimation caused by jointly injecting entropy and updating its weighting parameter, i.e., temperature; and (2) short-sighted local entropy tuning that adjusts temperature only according to the current single-step entropy, without considering the effect of cumulative entropy over time. In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function, explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability."}

In such settings, the target dataset is often limited, but multiple heterogeneous auxiliary sources may provide additional information. We develop transfer learning procedures that effectively leverage these auxiliary datasets to improve estimation accuracy, and establish non-asymptotic $\\ell_1$- and $\\ell_2$-error bounds for the proposed estimators. To prevent negative transfer, we introduce a data-driven source detection algorithm capable of identifying informative auxiliary datasets and prove its consistency.

This study introduces three-dimensional Null Subtraction Imaging (3D NSI), a nonlinear beamforming framework that addresses this trade-off by combining computationally efficient null-subtraction process with multiplexing-aware sparse aperture designs on matrix arrays. We evaluate three apodization configurations: a fully addressed circular aperture and two Fermat's spiral sparse apertures. To overcome channel-sharing constraints common in matrix arrays multiplexed with low-channel-count ultrasound systems, we propose a spiral \"no-reuse\" apodization that enforces non-overlapping element sets across transmit-receive events. This design resolves multiplexing conflicts and enables up to a 16-fold increase in acquisition volume rate using only 240 active elements on a 1024-element probe. In computer simulations and tissue-mimicking phantom experiments, 3D NSI achieved an average improvement of 36% in azimuthal and elevational resolutions, along with an approximately 20% higher contrast ratio, compared to the conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamformer under matched transmit/receive configurations. When implemented with the spiral no-reuse aperture, the 3D NSI framework achieved over 1000 volumes per second with a computational load less than three times that of DAS, making it a practical solution for real-time 4D imaging."}

Modern surveillance faces an exponentially harder problem: screening populations across thousands of attributes using threshold rules rather than exact matching. Intuition suggests that requiring many coincidental matches should make false alerts astronomically unlikely. This intuition fails.\n  Consider a system that monitors 1,000 attributes, each with a 0.5 percent innocent match rate. Matching 15 pre-specified attributes has probability \\(10^{-35}\\), one in 30 decillion, effectively impossible. But operational systems require no such specificity. They might flag anyone who matches \\emph{any} 15 of the 1,000. In a city of one million innocent people, this produces about 226 false alerts. A seemingly impossible event becomes all but guaranteed. This is not an implementation flaw but a mathematical consequence of high-dimensional screening.\n  We identify fundamental probabilistic limits on screening reliability. Systems undergo sharp transitions from reliable to unreliable with small increases in data scale, a fragility worsened by data growth and correlations. As data accumulate and correlation collapses effective dimensionality, systems enter regimes where alerts lose evidential value even when individual coincidences remain vanishingly rare. This framework reframes the DNA database controversy as a shift between operational regimes. Unequal surveillance exposures magnify failure, making ``structural bias'' mathematically inevitable. These limits are structural: beyond a critical scale, failure cannot be prevented through threshold adjustment or algorithmic refinement."}

Furthermore, this set-theoretic framework allows for the optimized selection of the proposed control law parameters to guarantee pre-specified performance bounds. The efficacy of the synthesized controller is demonstrated in the challenging application of maintaining tight formations in a multi-obstacles environment."}

The unprecedented scale and reliance on information disseminated through these systems substantially expand the scope of information-based influence that can both enable and undermine sound decision-making. Consequently, understanding and protecting decision-making today faces growing challenges, as individuals and organizations must navigate evolving opportunities and information-based threats across varied domains and information environments. While these risks are widely recognized, research remains fragmented: work evaluating information-based threat phenomena has progressed largely in isolation from foundational studies of human information processing. In this review, we synthesize insights from both domains to identify shared cognitive mechanisms that mediate vulnerability to information-based threats and shape behavioral outcomes. Finally, we outline directions for future research aimed at integrating these perspectives, emphasizing the importance of such integration for mitigating human vulnerabilities and aligning human-machine representations."}

These complexities present significant challenges for automated valuation models (AVMs), which are increasingly used to provide objective assessments for property taxation and mortgage financing. The challenge of obtaining accurate and objective valuations for properties at a country level, and not just within major cities, is further compounded by the presence of multiple localised submarkets-spanning urban, suburban, and rural contexts-where property features contribute differently to value. Existing AVMs often struggle in such settings: traditional hedonic regression models lack the flexibility to capture spatial variation, while advanced machine learning approaches demand extensive datasets that are rarely available. In this article, we address these limitations by developing a robust statistical framework for property valuation in the Irish housing market. We segment the country into six submarkets encompassing cities, large towns, and rural areas, and employ a generalized additive model that captures non-linear effects of property characteristics while allowing feature contributions to vary across submarkets. Our approach outperforms both machine learning-based and traditional hedonic regression models, particularly in data-sparse regions. In out-of-sample validation, our model achieves R-squared values of 0.70, 0.84, and 0.83 for rural areas, towns, and Dublin, respectively, compared to 0.52, 0.71, and 0.82 from a random forest benchmark. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of our model align closely with reported inflation figures for the study period, providing additional validation of its accuracy."}

We first consider the linear function approximation setting and conduct a fine-grained analysis of the linear-categorical Bellman equation. Building on this analysis, we further incorporate variance reduction techniques in our new algorithms to establish tight sample complexity bounds independent of the support size $K$ when $K$ is large.

The performance of denoising is assessed with two metrics: the standard Structural Similarity Index SSIMImg of restored and clean images and a newly applied metric SSIMMap - the SSIM of entropy maps of these images computed via 2D Sample Entropy in sliding windows. We shown that SSIMMap is more sensitive to blur and local intensity transitions and complements SSIMImg. Experiments on low- and high-resolution grayscales images demonstrate that recursive threshold MF robustly restores images even under strong noise (50-60 %), whereas simple AE is only capable of restoring images with low levels of noise (<30 %). We propose two scalable schemes: (i) 2MF, which uses two MFs with different window sizes and a final thresholding step, effective for highlighting sharp local details at low resolution; and (ii) MFs-AE, which aggregates features from multiple MFs via an AE and is beneficial for restoring the overall scene structure at higher resolution. Owing to its simplicity and computational efficiency, MF remains preferable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms (edge/IoT), whereas AE underperforms without prior denoising. The results also validate the practical value of SSIMMap for objective blur assessment and denoising parameter tuning."}

Data are split into $K$ \"folds,\" where one fold (i.e., hold-out set) is used to evaluate a model's predictive ability. Researchers typically rely on conventions when choosing $K$, commonly $K=5$, or $80{:}20$ split, even though the choice of $K$ can affect inference and model evaluation. Principally, this $K$ should be determined by balancing the predictive accuracy (bias) and the uncertainty of this accuracy (variance), which forms a tradeoff based on the size of the hold-out set. More training data means more accurate models, but fewer testing data lead to uncertain evaluation, and vice versa. The challenge is that this evaluation uncertainty cannot be estimated directly from data. We propose a procedure to determine the optimal $K$ by deriving a finite-sample upper bound on the evaluation uncertainty and adopting a utility-based approach to make this tradeoff explicit. Analyses of real-world datasets using linear regression and random forest demonstrate this procedure in practice, providing insight into implicit assumptions, robustness, and model performance. Critically, the results show that the optimal $K$ depends on both the data and the model, and that conventional choices implicitly make assumptions about the fundamental characteristics of the data. Our framework makes these assumptions explicit and provides a principled, transparent way to select $K$ based on the data and model rather than convention. By replacing a one-size-fits-all choice with context-specific reasoning, it enables more reliable comparisons of predictive performance across scientific domains."}

Normalized entropy maps entropy values to the [0,1] interval through standardization, accurately capturing relative changes in data complexity. By utilizing a sliding window to compute normalized entropy, this approach transforms the challenge of detecting change points in complex time series, arising from variations in scale, distribution, and diversity, into the task of identifying significant features within the normalized entropy sequence, thereby avoiding interference from parametric assumptions and effectively highlighting distributional shifts. Experimental results show that normalized entropy exhibits significant numerical fluctuation characteristics and patterns near change points across various distributions and parameter combinations. The average deviation between fluctuation moments and actual change points is only 2.4% of the sliding window size, demonstrating strong adaptability. This paper provides theoretical support for change-point detection in complex data environments and lays a methodological foundation for precise and automated detection based on normalized entropy as a fundamental metric."}

Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.\n  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\\% of the time while missing only 8.3\\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required.

Part A: Stochastic Stability in Non-zero-Sum Games", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.GT", "cs.MA", "math.OC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games."}

In this work, we introduce SIMBA, a Scalable Image Modeling using a Bayesian Approach, for group-level fMRI analysis, which places Gaussian process (GP) priors on spatially varying functions to capture smooth and interpretable spatial association patterns across the brain volume. To address the significant computational challenges of GP inference in high-dimensional neuroimaging data, we employ a low-rank kernel approximation that enables projection into a reduced-dimensional subspace. This allows for efficient posterior computation without sacrificing spatial resolution, and we have developed efficient algorithms for this implemented in Python that achieve fully Bayesian inference either within minutes using the Gibbs sampler or within seconds using mean-field variational inference (VI). Through extensive simulation studies, we first show that SIMBA outperforms competing methods in estimation accuracy, activation detection sensitivity, and uncertainty quantification, especially in low signal-to-noise settings. We further demonstrate the scalability and interpretability of SIMBA in large-scale task-based fMRI applications, analyzing both volumetric and cortical surface data from the NARPS and ABCD studies."}

While early analog RAF circuits employed nonlinear coupling and suffered from process sensitivity, modern ML practice favors linear recurrence. In this work, we introduce a resonate-and-fire (RAF) neuron, built in 22nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator technology, that aligns with SSM principles while retaining the efficiency of spike-based communication. We analyze its dynamics, linearity, and resilience to Process, Voltage, and Temperature variations, and evaluate its power, performance, and area trade-offs. We map the characteristics of our circuit into a system-level simulation where our RAF neuron is utilized in a keyword-spotting task, showing that its non-idealities do not hinder performance. Our results establish RAF neurons as robust, energy-efficient computational primitives for neuromorphic hardware."}

A foundational explanation for this in linear classification was recently provided by Hashimoto et al. (2025). However, this analysis was limited to the setting of \"homogeneous\" models, which lack a bias (intercept) term - a standard component in practice. This work directly extends Hashimoto et al.'s results to the more realistic inhomogeneous case, which incorporates a bias term. Our analysis proves that benign overfitting persists in these more complex models. We find that the presence of the bias term introduces new constraints on the data's covariance structure required for generalization, an effect that is particularly pronounced when label noise is present. However, we show that in the isotropic case, these new constraints are dominated by the requirements inherited from the homogeneous model. This work provides a more complete picture of benign overfitting, revealing the non-trivial impact of the bias term on the conditions required for good generalization."}

We introduce an innovative parameter selection criterion that establishes a precise mathematical equivalence between AFDM subcarriers and Nyquist-sampled frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW). This connection not only provides a clear physical insight into AFDM's sensing mechanism but also enables a direct mapping from the DAFT index to delay-Doppler (DD) parameters of wireless channels. Building on this, we develop a novel input-output model in a DD-parameterized DAFT (DD-DAFT) domain for AFDM, which explicitly reveals the inherent DD coupling effect arising from the chirp-channel interaction. Subsequently, we design two matched-filtering sensing algorithms. The first is performed in the time-frequency domain with low complexity, while the second is operated in the DD-DAFT domain to precisely resolve the DD coupling. Simulations show that our algorithms achieve effective pilot-free sensing and demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between sensing performance, communication overhead, and computational complexity. The proposed AFDM outperforms classical AFDM and other variants in most scenarios."}

This advancement challenges the precise prediction of future maintenance needs for assets, which is crucial for reducing downtime and operational costs. However, the effectiveness of data-driven methodologies in the nuclear sector requires extensive domain knowledge due to the complexity of the systems involved. Thus, this paper proposes a novel predictive maintenance methodology that combines data-driven techniques with domain knowledge from a nuclear equipment. The methodological originality of this paper is located on two levels: highlighting the limitations of purely data-driven approaches and demonstrating the importance of knowledge in enhancing the performance of the predictive models. The applicative novelty of this work lies in its use within a domain such as a nuclear industry, which is highly restricted and ultrasensitive due to security, economic and environmental concerns. A detailed real-world case study which compares the current state of equipment monitoring with two scenarios, demonstrate that the methodology significantly outperforms purely data-driven methods in failure prediction. While purely data-driven methods achieve only a modest performance with a prediction horizon limited to 3 h and a F1 score of 56.36%, the hybrid approach increases the prediction horizon to 24 h and achieves a higher F1 score of 93.12%."}

Existing analyses have focused on local constant estimators and given samples, leaving the principles of transferring knowledge from auxiliary sources across heterogeneous time-varying domains insufficiently established. We derive uniform convergence for multivariate locally linear estimators under strong mixing. The resulting error expansion decomposes stochastic variation, smoothing bias, and a term induced by local stationarity. This additional term, originating from the locally stationary structure, has smaller order than in the Nadaraya-Watson benchmark, explaining the improved local linear performance. Building on these results, we propose bias-corrected transfer learned estimators that connect a sparsely observed series with densely observed related sources through a smoothly varying bias function defined over rescaled time and covariates. An additional refinement shows how local temporal adjustment of this bias enhances stability and enables efficient information borrowing across domains. Simulation studies and an empirical analysis of international fuel prices support the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the practical advantages of transfer learning."}

Both the defender and the intruders have non-holonomic dynamics. The intruders' objective is to breach the target perimeter without being captured by the defender, while the defender's goal is to capture as many intruders as possible. After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte-Carlo-type random trials of experiments."}

The design of \\texttt{hedom5} is inspired by recent iterative-greedy style domination heuristics~\\cite{IterativeGreedy22} that alternate between constructive steps, pruning, and focused repair rather than relying on a single pass. In \\texttt{hedom5}, the input graph is first stored in a compact CSR structure and simplified using fast reductions such as forcing neighbors of leaves and handling isolates. We then run a lazy gain-based greedy stage using a priority queue: each candidate vertex is scored by how many currently undominated vertices its closed neighborhood would newly dominate, and scores are only recomputed when necessary. After this constructive phase, we perform an aggressive backward pruning pass that iterates over the chosen dominators in reverse insertion order and deletes any vertex whose closed neighborhood is still fully dominated by the remaining set. Finally, we run a budgeted 1-swap local improvement step that attempts to replace a dominator by an alternative vertex that covers all of its uniquely covered vertices, thereby reducing the size of the dominating set. A brief safety patch at the end guarantees full domination."}

This is the extended version, including the technical appendix", "summary": "Precise estimation and uncertainty quantification for average crop yields are critical for agricultural monitoring and decision making. Existing data collection methods, such as crop cuts in randomly sampled fields at harvest time, are relatively time-consuming. Thus, we propose an approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI) to supplement these crop cuts with less time-consuming field photos. After training a computer vision model to predict the ground truth crop cut yields from the photos, we learn a ``control function\" that recalibrates these predictions with the spatial coordinates of each field. This enables fields with photos but not crop cuts to be leveraged to improve the precision of zone-wide average yield estimates. Our control function is learned by training on a dataset of nearly 20,000 real crop cuts and photos of rice and maize fields in sub-Saharan Africa. To improve precision, we pool training observations across different zones within the same first-level subdivision of each country. Our final PPI-based point estimates of the average yield are provably asymptotically unbiased and cannot increase the asymptotic variance beyond that of the natural baseline estimator -- the sample average of the crop cuts -- as the number of fields grows. We also propose a novel bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap to construct accompanying confidence intervals. Even in zones with as few as 20 fields, the point estimates show significant empirical improvement over the baseline, increasing the effective sample size by as much as 73% for rice and by 12-23% for maize. The confidence intervals are accordingly shorter at minimal cost to empirical finite-sample coverage. This demonstrates the potential for relatively low-cost images to make area-based crop insurance more affordable and thus spur investment into sustainable agricultural practices."}

To address this issue, we introduce the Clustering Orthogonal Weight Modified (COWM) layer, which can be integrated into the policy network of any RL algorithm and mitigate non-stationarity effectively. The COWM layer stabilizes the learning process by employing clustering techniques and a projection matrix. Our approach not only improves learning speed but also reduces gradient interference, thereby enhancing the overall learning efficiency.

APSP builds upon existing Bayesian data borrowing frameworks, incorporating data-driven adaptive information selection, structure of mixture shrinkage informative priors and decision making with empirical null to enhance variable selection performances under small sample size. Extensive simulations show that APSP attains better efficiency relative to traditional and popular data-borrowing and Bayesian variable-selection methods while maintaining robustness under linear relationships.

The problem is exacerbated in autoregressive (AR) LLM inference, where per-token forward passes repeatedly generate bulky intermediate features (IFs). We introduce SLICER, a retraining-free, architecture-agnostic framework that compresses IFs to reduce both communication and server load in split computing. SLICER combines (i) asymmetric top-K filtering (ATKF) to sparsify low-magnitude activations, (ii) magnitude-splitting (MS) to group the remaining non-zeros into equal-cardinality blocks, and (iii) adaptive bit quantization (ABQ) that selects per-block bitwidths under a distortion budget.

In multi-device settings and AR LLMs, SLICER scales by shifting meaningful compute to the edge and lowering bits-per-token and server time per token, stabilizing per-step traffic. The codec attaches to off-the-shelf models without retraining or architectural changes, offering a plug-and-play path to scalable, low-latency distributed inference.

Specifically, let $M$ denote a diameter 1 d-dimensional manifold and $μ$ a probability measure on $M$ that is mutually absolutely continuous with the volume measure. Suppose $X_1,\\dots,X_N$ are i.i.d. samples of $μ$ and we observe noisy-distance random variables $d'(X_j, X_k)$ that are related to the true geodesic distances $d(X_j,X_k)$. With mild assumptions on the distributions and independence of the noisy distances, we develop a new framework for recovering all distances between points in a sufficiently dense subsample of $M$. Our framework improves on previous work which assumed i.i.d. additive noise with known moments. Our method is based on a new way to estimate $L_2$-norms of certain expectation-functions $f_x(y)=\\mathbb{E}d'(x,y)$ and use them to build robust clusters centered at points of our sample. Using a new geometric argument, we establish that, under mild geometric assumptions--bounded curvature and positive injectivity radius--these clusters allow one to recover the true distances between points in the sample up to an additive error of $O(\\varepsilon \\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$. We develop two distinct algorithms for producing these clusters. The first achieves a sample complexity $N \\asymp \\varepsilon^{-2d-2}\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$ and runtime $o(N^3)$. The second introduces novel geometric ideas that warrant further investigation. In the presence of missing observations, we show that a quantitative lower bound on sampling probabilities suffices to modify the cluster construction in the first algorithm and extend all recovery guarantees. Our main technical result also elucidates which properties of a manifold are necessary for the distance recovery, which suggests further extension of our techniques to a broader class of metric probability spaces."}

Our framework shows that a second-order efficient empirical Bayes confidence interval, with EB coverage error of order $O(m^{-3/2})$, $m$ being the number of areas in the area-level model, can also be viewed as a credible interval whose posterior coverage is close to the nominal level, provided a carefully chosen prior - referred to as a 'matching prior' - is placed on the hyperparameters. While existing literature has examined matching priors that reconcile frequentist and Bayesian inference in various settings, this paper is the first to study matching priors with the goal of interval estimation of random effects in a two-level model.

This work addresses the day-ahead offering problem through a two-stage robust adaptive stochastic optimization model, wherein the first-stage price-quantity pairs and second-stage operational commitment decisions are made before and after DER uncertainty is realized, respectively. Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture.

This study evaluates twenty-one publicly available LLMs on a representative heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) workload mapping and scheduling problem. Each model received the same textual description of system nodes, task requirements, and scheduling constraints, and was required to assign tasks to nodes, compute the total makespan, and explain its reasoning. A manually derived analytical optimum of nine hours and twenty seconds served as the ground truth reference. Three models exactly reproduced the analytical optimum while satisfying all constraints, twelve achieved near-optimal results within two minutes of the reference, and six produced suboptimal schedules with arithmetic or dependency errors. All models generated feasible task-to-node mappings, though only about half maintained strict constraint adherence. Nineteen models produced partially executable verification code, and eighteen provided coherent step-by-step reasoning, demonstrating strong interpretability even when logical errors occurred. Overall, the results define the current capability boundary of LLM reasoning in combinatorial optimization: leading models can reconstruct optimal schedules directly from natural language, but most still struggle with precise timing, data transfer arithmetic, and dependency enforcement.

The proposed framework integrates natural-language inputs from users and Bayesian estimators of the environment into adaptive safety certificates that explicitly account for user preferences, system dynamics, and quantified uncertainties.

Reliability analysis, which determines the probability of failure after accounting for pertinent uncertainties, is essential for ensuring the safety of pipeline systems. However, traditional reliability analysis methods involving computationally intensive numerical models, such as finite element simulations of pipeline subjected to ground movement, have limited applications; this is partly because stochastic sampling approaches require repeated simulations over a large number of samples for the uncertain variables when estimating low probabilities. This study introduces Physics-Informed Neural Network for Reliability Analysis (PINN-RA) for buried pipelines subjected to ground movement, which integrates PINN-based surrogate model with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to achieve efficient reliability assessment. To enable its application under uncertain variables associated with soil properties and ground movement, the PINN-based surrogate model is extended to solve a parametric differential equation system, namely the governing equation of pipelines embedded in soil with different properties. The findings demonstrate that PINN-RA significantly reduces the computational effort required and thus accelerates reliability analysis. By eliminating the need for repetitive numerical evaluations of pipeline subjected to permanent ground movement, the proposed approach provides an efficient and scalable tool for pipeline reliability assessment, enabling rapid decision-making in geohazard-prone regions."}

Because ELAA training and data transmission consume energy and training trades off with service time, we pose a cross-layer control problem that couples PHY-layer beam management with MAC-layer service under delay-sensitive traffic. The controller decides when to retrain and how aggressively to train (pilot count and sparsity) while allocating transmit power, explicitly balancing pilot overhead, data-phase rate, and energy to reduce the queueing delay of MAC-layer frames/packets to be transmitted. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and solve it with deep reinforcement learning.

The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $<10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol.

Through the use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based lightweight audit logging instead of heavyweight blockchain consensus, the median cost of getting a $95^{th}$ percentile decision within 50ms is observed across all tested swarm sizes.

Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination.\n  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture."}

Our goal is exact yet computationally efficient maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in regimes where many observations contain small counts, which imperils both identifiability and numerical stability. We develop three novel Kendall's tau-based approaches for initialization tailored to discrete margins in the low-count regime and embed it within an inference functions for margins (IFM) inspired start. We present three practical initializers (exact, low-intensity approximation, and a transformation-based approach) that substantially reduce the number of ML iterations and improve convergence. For the ML stage, we use an unconstrained reparameterization of the model's parameters using the log and spherical-Cholesky and compute exact rectangle probabilities. Analytical score functions are supplied throughout to stabilize Newton-type optimization. A simulation study across dimensions, dependence levels, and intensity regimes shows that the proposed initialization combined with exact ML achieves lower root-mean-squared error, lower bias and faster computation times than the alternative procedures.

This spectral non-uniformity directly induces severe distortion in the target's HRRP, consequently compromising the performance and reliability of conventional HRRP-based target recognition methods. This paper proposes a novel, end-to-end trained network for robust radar target recognition. The core of our model is a CFA module that operates directly on the complex spectrum of the received echo. The CFA module learns to generate an adaptive frequency-domain filter, assigning lower weights to bands corrupted by strong jamming while preserving critical target information in cleaner bands. The filtered spectrum is then fed into a classifier backbone for recognition. Experimental results on simulated HRRP data with various jamming combinations demonstrate our method's superiority. Notably, under severe jamming conditions, our model achieves a recognition accuracy nearly 9% higher than traditional model-based approaches, all while introducing negligible computational overhead. This highlights its exceptional performance and robustness in challenging jamming environments."}

We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities.

Building upon previous research, the present study further investigates the termination of the approximation at an optimal spatial resolution, addressing the absence of higher frequencies in typical ear canal measurements and enhancing the accuracy of the inverse solution.

Although recent deep learning and numerical acceleration methods have improved speed and scalability, they often rely on single CNN architectures or single neural operators, which struggle to generalize in unknown or complex geological settings and are ineffective at distinguishing diverse geological types. To address these issues, we propose a Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture for velocity-field inversion under unknown subsurface structures. First, a structure-aligned encoder maps high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, thereby eliminating spatio-temporal mismatch between the waveform and velocity domains, recovering high-frequency components, and enhancing feature generalization. Then, an adaptive routing mechanism selects and fuses multiple neural-operator experts, including spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators, to predict the velocity model. We systematically evaluate our approach on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset. Results show that SA-EMO significantly outperforms traditional CNN or single-operator methods, achieving an average MAE reduction of approximately 58.443% and an improvement in boundary resolution of about 10.308%. Ablation studies further reveal that the structure-aligned encoder, the expert-fusion mechanism, and the routing module each contribute markedly to the performance gains.

This paper presents a novel algorithmic solution to this problem, designed to reconstruct a sharp, full-color image from two inputs: a sharp, bandpass-filtered grayscale ``structure image'' and a heavily distorted ``color cue'' image, both captured by the metalens system. Our method utilizes a dual-branch diffusion model, built upon a pre-trained Stable Diffusion XL framework, to fuse information from the two inputs. We demonstrate through quantitative and qualitative comparisons that our approach significantly outperforms existing deblurring and pansharpening methods, effectively restoring high-frequency details while accurately colorizing the image."}

This \"one-policy-fits-all\" approach leads to significant compromises in fairness, throughput, and latency, particularly with the rise of heterogeneous hardware and varied application architectures.\n  This paper proposes a new paradigm: dynamically selecting the optimal policy from a portfolio of specialized schedulers rather than designing a single, monolithic one. We present the Adaptive Scheduling Agent (ASA), a lightweight framework that intelligently matches workloads to the most suitable \"expert\" scheduling policy at runtime. ASA's core is a novel, low-overhead offline/online approach. First, an offline process trains a universal, hardware-agnostic machine learning model to recognize abstract workload patterns from system behaviors. Second, at runtime, ASA continually processes the model's predictions using a time-weighted probability voting algorithm to identify the workload, then makes a scheduling decision by consulting a pre-configured, machine-specific mapping table to switch to the optimal scheduler via Linux's sched_ext framework. This decoupled architecture allows ASA to adapt to new hardware platforms rapidly without expensive retraining of the core recognition model.\n  Our evaluation, based on a novel benchmark focused on user-experience metrics, demonstrates that ASA consistently outperforms the default Linux scheduler (EEVDF), achieving superior results in 86.4% of test scenarios. Furthermore, ASA's selections are near-optimal, ranking among the top three schedulers in 78.6% of all scenarios. This validates our approach as a practical path toward more intelligent, adaptive, and responsive operating system schedulers."}

In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to filter the projection data but are ill-suited for this task as they apply grid-based convolutions to the sinogram, which inherently lies on a line manifold, not a regular grid. The CNNs, unaware of the geometry, are implicitly tied to it and require an excessive amount of parameters as they must infer the relations between measurements from the data rather than from prior information.\n  The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a graph data structure to represent CT acquisition geometries and tomographic data, providing a detailed explanation of the graph's structure for circular, cone-beam geometries. Second, we propose GLM, a hybrid neural network architecture that leverages both graph and grid convolutions to process tomographic data.\n  We demonstrate that GLM outperforms CNNs when performance is quantified in terms of structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio, despite the fact that GLM uses only a fraction of the trainable parameters. Compared to CNNs, GLM also requires significantly less training time and memory, and its memory requirements scale better. Crucially, GLM demonstrates robust generalization to unseen variations in the acquisition geometry, like when training only on fully sampled CT data and then testing on sparse-view CT data."}

The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Our method designs are validated on industrial SGS and public UCR datasets, showing better generalization for unseen data in SGS recognition."}

In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time.

To more accurately delineate the effective near field region, we introduce the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), an angle dependent metric that bounds the spatial region where beamfocusing remains effective. Closed form expressions for both beamdepth and EBRD are derived for UCAs. Our analysis shows that, under a fixed antenna element count, ULAs achieve narrower beamdepth and a longer EBRD than UCAs. Conversely, under a fixed aperture length, UCAs provide slightly narrower beamdepth and a marginally longer EBRD. Simulation results further confirm that ULAs achieve higher sum rate under the fixed element constraint, while UCAs offer marginal performance gain under the fixed aperture constraint."}

To improve the generalization, we explore the substructures of classifiers and propose a novel meta-learning algorithm to learn each classifier as a combination of meta-components. Meta-components are learned across meta-learning episodes on seen classes and disentangled by imposing an orthogonal regularizer to promote its diversity and capture various shared substructures among different classifiers.

Existing uniform coverage strategies are insufficient for realistic applications, and many non-uniform approaches either lack optimality guarantees or fail to incorporate crucial real-world constraints such as agent dynamics, limited operation time, the number of agents, and decentralized execution.\n  To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC). The central idea of D2OC is the integration of optimal transport theory with multi-agent coverage control, enabling each agent to continuously adjust its trajectory to match a mission-specific reference density map. The proposed formulation establishes optimality by solving a constrained optimization problem that explicitly incorporates physical and operational constraints. The resulting control input is analytically derived from the Lagrangian of the objective function, yielding closed-form optimal solutions for linear systems and a generalizable structure for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a decentralized data-sharing mechanism is developed to coordinate agents without reliance on global information.\n  Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that D2OC achieves significantly improved non-uniform area coverage performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining scalability and decentralized implementability."}

As tumors expand, they induce substantial anatomical deformation that disrupts both local tissue organization and global brain architecture, complicating diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. Yet a subject-specific reference of how the brain would appear without tumor-induced changes is fundamentally unobtainable in clinical practice. We present BrainNormalizer, an anatomy-informed diffusion framework that reconstructs pseudo-healthy MRIs directly from tumorous scans by conditioning the generative process on boundary cues extracted from the subject's own anatomy. This boundary-guided conditioning enables anatomically plausible pseudo-healthy reconstruction without requiring paired non-tumorous and tumorous scans. BrainNormalizer employs a two-stage training strategy. The pretrained diffusion model is first adapted through inpainting-based fine-tuning on tumorous and non-tumorous scans. Next, an edge-map-guided ControlNet branch is trained to inject fine-grained anatomical contours into the frozen decoder while preserving learned priors. During inference, a deliberate misalignment strategy pairs tumorous inputs with non-tumorous prompts and mirrored contralateral edge maps, leveraging hemispheric correspondence to guide reconstruction. On the BraTS2020 dataset, BrainNormalizer achieves strong quantitative performance and qualitatively produces anatomically plausible reconstructions in tumor-affected regions while retaining overall structural coherence.

Probabilistic calibration metrics (Brier Score and Expected Calibration Error) are incorporated to ensure reliable risk predictions across subgroups. Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models were trained with isotonic and Platt scaling for calibration and fairness comparison. A calibrated Random Forest achieved a high predictive accuracy of 90.8%. SHAP analysis identified follicle count, weight gain, and menstrual irregularity as the most influential features, which are consistent with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria.

In this work, we build on the recently proposed `SamAdams' framework for timestep adaptation (Leimkuhler, Lohmann, and Whalley 2025), introducing an adaptive scheme: SA-SGLD, which employs time rescaling to modulate the stepsize according to a monitored quantity (typically the local gradient norm). SA-SGLD can automatically shrink stepsizes in regions of high curvature and expand them in flatter regions, improving both stability and mixing without introducing bias.

The key challenge is communication-limited partial observability, leaving each UAV with a narrow, fast-changing neighborhood view that destabilizes value estimation. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches are inadequate--non-communication methods rely on unavailable global critics, heuristic sharing is brittle and redundant, and learnable protocols (e.g., CommNet, DIAL) lose per-neighbor structure and aggravate non-stationarity under tight bandwidth. To address partial observability, we propose a spatiotemporal A2C where each UAV transmits prior-decision messages with local state, a compact policy fingerprint, and a recurrent belief, encoded per neighbor and concatenated. A spatial discount shapes value targets to emphasize local interactions, while analysis under one-hop-per-slot latency explains stable training with delayed views.

Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores.

The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems."}

For example, an oncologist may first conduct a breast exam, followed by a mammogram for patients with concerning exams, followed by a biopsy for patients with concerning mammograms. A key challenge is that the ground truth outcome, such as the biopsy result, is only revealed at the end of this funnel. The selective censoring of the ground truth can introduce statistical biases in risk estimation, especially in underserved patient groups, whose outcomes are more frequently censored. We develop a Bayesian model for funnel decision structures, drawing from prior work on selective labels and censoring. We first show in synthetic settings that our model is able to recover the true parameters and predict outcomes for censored patients more accurately than baselines. We then apply our model to a dataset of emergency department visits, where in-hospital mortality is observed only for those who are admitted to either the hospital or ICU. We find that there are gender-based differences in hospital and ICU admissions. In particular, our model estimates that the mortality risk threshold to admit women to the ICU is higher for women (5.1%) than for men (4.5%)."}

Concurrently, data acquisition and realtime system state monitoring are becoming more available for control centers. This motivates shifting from \\textit{model- and Lyapunov-based} feedback controller designs toward \\textit{model-free} ones. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key tool for designing model-free controllers. Various studies have been carried out to study voltage/frequency control strategies via RL. However, usually a simplified system model is used neglecting detailed dynamics of solar, wind, and composite loads -- and damping system-wide oscillations and modeling power flows are all usually ignored. To that end, we pose an optimal feedback control problem for a detailed renewables-heavy power system, defined by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (NDAE). The control problem is solved using a completely model-free design via RL as well as using a model-based approach built upon the Lyapunov stability theory with guarantees. The paper in its essence seeks to explore whether data-driven feedback control should be used in power grids over its model-driven counterpart. Theoretical developments and thorough case studies are presented with an eye on this exploration. Finally, a detailed analysis is provided to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for renewables-heavy grids."}

Although climbing plants have been studied for a long time, extracting information regarding the relationship between the temporal shape change, the event that triggers it, and the contact location is still challenging. To help build this relation, we propose an image-based method by which it is possible to analyze shape changes over time in tendrils when mechano-stimulated in different portions of their body. We employ a geometric approach using a 3D Piece-Wise Clothoid-based model to reconstruct the configuration taken by a tendril after mechanical rubbing. The reconstruction shows high robustness and reliability with an accuracy of R2 > 0.99. This method demonstrates distinct advantages over deep learning-based approaches, including reduced data requirements, lower computational costs, and interpretability. Our analysis reveals higher responsiveness in the apical segment of tendrils, which might correspond to higher sensitivity and tissue flexibility in that region of the organs.

It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability.

Many learning-based and model-based methods exist that estimate event-based optical flow, however the temporally dense yet spatially sparse nature of events poses significant challenges. To address these issues, contrast maximization (CM) is a prominent model-based optimization methodology that estimates the motion trajectories of events within an event volume by optimally warping them. Since its introduction, the CM framework has undergone a series of refinements by the computer vision community. Nonetheless, it remains a highly non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biologically-inspired hybrid CM method for event-based optical flow estimation that couples visual and inertial motion cues. Concretely, we propose the use of orientation maps, derived from camera 3D velocities, as priors to guide the CM process. The orientation maps provide directional guidance and constrain the space of estimated motion trajectories. We show that this orientation-guided formulation leads to improved robustness and convergence in event-based optical flow estimation.

This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence.

Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge.

Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text."}

Adaptive observers address this issue by performing simultaneous state and parameter estimation using only input-output measurements. While many adaptive observer designs exist for continuous-time systems, their discrete-time counterparts remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes an initial excitation (IE)-based adaptive observer for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. In contrast to conventional designs that rely on the persistence of excitation condition, which requires continuous excitation and infinite control effort, the proposed method does not require excitation for infinite time, thus making it more practical for stabilization tasks. We employ a two-layer filtering structure and a normalized gradient descent-based update law for learning the unknown parameters.

Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning."}

Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance."}

Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES."}

While deep learning recommendation algorithms can generate up to 3,297 kg CO2 per paper, ensemble methods have not been sufficiently evaluated for energy consumption. This thesis investigates how ensemble techniques influence environmental impact compared to single optimized models.\n  We conducted 93 experiments across two frameworks (Surprise for rating prediction, LensKit for ranking) on four datasets spanning 100,000 to 7.8 million interactions. We evaluated four ensemble strategies (Average, Weighted, Stacking/Rank Fusion, Top Performers) against simple baselines and optimized single models, measuring energy consumption with a smart plug.\n  Results revealed a non-linear accuracy-energy relationship. Ensemble methods achieved 0.3-5.7% accuracy improvements while consuming 19-2,549% more energy depending on dataset size and strategy. The Top Performers ensemble showed best efficiency: 0.96% RMSE improvement with 18.8% energy overhead on MovieLens-1M, and 5.7% NDCG improvement with 103% overhead on MovieLens-100K. Exhaustive averaging strategies consumed 88-270% more energy for comparable gains. On the largest dataset (Anime, 7.8M interactions), the Surprise ensemble consumed 2,005% more energy (0.21 Wh vs. 0.01 Wh) for 1.2% accuracy improvement, producing 53.8 mg CO2 versus 2.6 mg CO2 for the single model.\n  This research provides one of the first systematic measurements of energy and carbon footprint for ensemble recommender systems, demonstrates that selective strategies offer superior efficiency over exhaustive averaging, and identifies scalability limitations at industrial scale.

In recent years, various solutions have been proposed, with data-driven approaches gaining increasing attention due to their superior performance. In this paper, we propose a new method for leak detection. The method is based on water pressure measurements acquired at a series of nodes of a WDN. Our technique is a fully data-driven solution that makes only use of the knowledge of the WDN topology, and a series of pressure data acquisitions obtained in absence of leaks.

Traditional methods, such as nearest neighbor and clustering approaches, often depend on rigid assumptions, such as a predefined number of reliable neighbors or clusters, which frequently break down in complex temporal scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Granular-ball One-Class Network (GBOC), a novel approach based on a data-adaptive representation called Granular-ball Vector Data Description (GVDD). GVDD partitions the latent space into compact, high-density regions represented by granular-balls, which are generated through a density-guided hierarchical splitting process and refined by removing noisy structures. Each granular-ball serves as a prototype for local normal behavior, naturally positioning itself between individual instances and clusters while preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. During training, GBOC improves the compactness of representations by aligning samples with their nearest granular-ball centers. During inference, anomaly scores are computed based on the distance to the nearest granular-ball. By focusing on dense, high-quality regions and significantly reducing the number of prototypes, GBOC delivers both robustness and efficiency in anomaly detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to handle the challenges of time series anomaly detection."}

At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modeling assumptions that are untenable under single-point measurement constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves timely fault localization and cyber-resilient fault diagnosis using only one VPQ (voltage, active power, reactive power) measurement point. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritize the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter IBR-dominated microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6% (bias), 94.0% (noise), 92.8% (data replacement), and 95.7% (replay), while sustaining 96.7% under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the cyber-physical resilience of IBR-dominated microgrids."}

To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel feature selection approach for robust depression analysis, called Incomplete Depression Feature Selection with Missing EEG Channels (IDFS-MEC). IDFS-MEC integrates missing-channel indicator information and adaptive channel weighting learning into orthogonal regression to lessen the effects of incomplete channels on model construction, and then utilizes global redundancy minimization learning to reduce redundant information among selected feature subsets. Extensive experiments conducted on MODMA and PRED-d003 datasets reveal that the EEG feature subsets chosen by IDFS-MEC have superior performance than 10 popular feature selection methods among 3-, 64-, and 128-channel settings."}

Leveraging this insight, we propose Scaled Convergence InfoNCE (SC-InfoNCE), a novel loss function that introduces a tunable convergence target to flexibly control feature similarity alignment. By scaling the target matrix, SC-InfoNCE enables flexible control over feature similarity alignment, allowing the training objective to better match the statistical properties of downstream data. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including image, graph, and text tasks, show that SC-InfoNCE consistently achieves strong and reliable performance across diverse domains."}

Here, we present a step-wise station removal procedure to thin an existing WSN in Freiburg, Germany, and analyze the ability of WSN subsets to reproduce air temperature and humidity patterns of the entire original WSN for a year following a simulated reduction of WSN density. We found that substantial reductions in station numbers after one year of full deployment are possible while retaining high predictive accuracy. A reduction from 42 to 4 stations, for instance, increased mean prediction RMSEs from 0.69 K to 0.83 K for air temperature and from 3.8% to 4.4% for relative humidity, corresponding to RMSE increases of only 20% and 16%, respectively. Predictive accuracy is worse for remote stations in forests than for stations in built-up or open settings, but consistently better than a state-of-the-art numerical urban land-surface model (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme). Stations located at the edges between built-up and rural areas are most valuable when reconstructing city-wide climate characteristics.

Being aware of these, we propose CLIM-FS, a novel IMUFS method designed to address the mixed-missing problem. Specifically, we integrate the imputation of both missing views and variables into a feature selection model based on nonnegative orthogonal matrix factorization, enabling the joint learning of feature selection and adaptive data imputation. Furthermore, we fully leverage consensus cluster structure and cross-view local geometrical structure to enhance the synergistic learning process.

This paper develops an event-triggered control (ETC) framework for mitigating congestion in such systems, which are modeled using an extended Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) formulation consisting of coupled 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Ramp metering is employed as the boundary actuation mechanism. To reduce computational and communication burdens while avoiding excessive ramp signal changes, we design the ETC strategy based on the backstepping method, together with an observer-based ETC formulation for practical implementation under limited sensing. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis ensures exponential convergence and avoidance of Zeno behavior. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach under diverse traffic scenarios, including varying AV penetration rates, different spacing policies, multiple demand levels, and non-recurrent congestion patterns. Results show that ETC not only stabilizes mixed traffic flows but also significantly reduces control updates, improving driver comfort, and roadway safety. Higher AV penetration rates lead to longer release time and fewer triggering events, indicating the positive impact of AVs in mitigating traffic congestion while reducing computational resource usage. Compared to continuous backstepping controllers, the proposed ETC achieves near-equivalent stabilization performance with far fewer controller updates, resulting in longer signal release time that reduces driver distraction, which demonstrates great potential for ETC applications in traffic management."}

In contrast, Listwise methods can perceive the global ranking context, but suffer from inherent List Rigidity, leading to severe scalability and flexibility issues when handling large candidate sets. To address these challenges, we propose Groupwise, a novel reranking paradigm. In this approach, the query and a group of candidate documents are jointly fed into the model, which performs within-group comparisons to assign individual relevance scores to each document. This design retains the flexibility of Pointwise methods while enabling the comparative capability of Listwise methods. We further adopt GRPO for model training, equipped with a heterogeneous reward function that integrates ranking metrics with a distributional reward aimed at aligning score distributions across groups. To overcome the bottleneck caused by the scarcity of high quality labeled data, we further propose an innovative pipeline for synthesizing high quality retrieval and ranking data.

Despite its effectiveness, SC is prohibitively expensive at scale when naively applied to datasets, and it lacks a unified theoretical treatment of sample efficiency and scaling behavior. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of SC's scaling behavior and its variants, drawing on mode estimation and voting theory. We derive and empirically validate power law scaling for self-consistency across datasets, and analyze the sample efficiency for fixed-allocation and dynamic-allocation sampling schemes. From these insights, we introduce Blend-ASC, a novel variant of self-consistency that dynamically allocates samples to questions during inference, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency.

Aleatoric uncertainty is estimated using a regularized global density model, while epistemic uncertainty is formed from three complementary components that capture local support deficiency, manifold spectral collapse, and cross-layer feature inconsistency. These components are empirically orthogonal and require no sampling, no ensembling, and no additional forward passes. We integrate the decomposed uncertainty into a distribution free conformal calibration procedure that yields significantly tighter prediction intervals at matched coverage. Using these components for uncertainty guided adaptive model selection reduces compute by approximately 60 percent on MOT17 with negligible accuracy loss, enabling practical self regulating visual inference.

To address this non-convex problem, a three-stage optimization algorithm is developed to sequentially optimize both the PT and ST pinching beamforming, and the ST power control. For the PT and ST pinching beamforming optimization, the coarse positions of PA are first determined at the waveguide-level. Then, wavelength-level refinements achieve constructive signal combination at the intended user and destructive superposition at the unintended user. For the ST power control, a closed-form solution is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that i) PAs can achieve significant SE improvements over conventional fixed-position antennas; ii) the proposed pinching beamforming design achieves effective interference suppression and superior performance for both even and odd numbers of PAs; and iii) the developed three-stage optimization algorithm enables nearly orthogonal transmission between the primary and secondary networks."}

Based on the optimal transport theory, we introduce the center-outward q-dominance relation and prove it implies strong first-order stochastic dominance (FSD). Also, we develop an empirical test procedure based on q-dominance, and derive an explicit sample size threshold, $n^*(δ)$, to control the Type I error. We verify the usefulness of our approach in two scenarios: (1) as a ranking method in hyperparameter tuning; (2) as a selection method in multi-objective optimization algorithms. For the former, we analyze the final stochastic Pareto sets of seven multi-objective hyperparameter tuners on the YAHPO-MO benchmark tasks with q-dominance, which allows us to compare these tuners when the expected hypervolume indicator (HVI, the most common performance metric) of the Pareto sets becomes indistinguishable. For the latter, we replace the mean value-based selection in the NSGA-II algorithm with $q$-dominance, which shows a superior convergence rate on noise-augmented ZDT benchmark problems. These results establish center-outward q-dominance as a principled, tractable foundation for seeking truly stochastically dominant solutions for SMOOPs."}

The proposed method begins by constructing a trajectory-dependent stability indicator function to distinguish the system's destiny. To overcome the difficulty in analyzing the asymptotic behavior at infinite time, a strategic time contraction mapping is then applied. This allows TSA to be recast as a pole-placement detection problem for the indicator function. By leveraging high-order derivatives at the initial state, a rational function approximation is derived, yielding a mathematically direct and computationally efficient prediction. Numerical validations on benchmark systems demonstrate that the method not only provides a direct mathematical shortcut for TSA in power systems but also establishes a promising new methodology for evaluating the transient stability of a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems."}

However, existing generative SE approaches often overlook the risk of hallucination under severe noise, leading to incorrect spoken content or inconsistent speaker characteristics, which we term linguistic and acoustic hallucinations, respectively. We argue that linguistic hallucination stems from models' failure to constrain valid phonological structures and it is a more fundamental challenge. While language models (LMs) are well-suited for capturing the underlying speech structure through modeling the distribution of discrete tokens, existing approaches are limited in learning from noise-corrupted representations, which can lead to contaminated priors and hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Phonologically Anchored Speech Enhancer (PASE), a generative SE framework that leverages the robust phonological prior embedded in the pre-trained WavLM model to mitigate hallucinations. First, we adapt WavLM into a denoising expert via representation distillation to clean its final-layer features. Guided by the model's intrinsic phonological prior, this process enables robust denoising while minimizing linguistic hallucinations. To further reduce acoustic hallucinations, we train the vocoder with a dual-stream representation: the high-level phonetic representation provides clean linguistic content, while a low-level acoustic representation retains speaker identity and prosody. Experimental results demonstrate that PASE not only surpasses state-of-the-art discriminative models in perceptual quality, but also significantly outperforms prior generative models with substantially lower linguistic and acoustic hallucinations."}

Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-Weighted Feature Fusion Network (DWFF-Net). The encoder of this model utilizes a frozen-parameter DINOv3 to extract foundational features. By analyzing the relationships between different category images and feature maps, we introduce a data-level adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for feature fusion.

Extending this to multiclass classification has long been challenging, since Natarajan's work in the late 80s proposing the Natarajan dimension (Nat) as a natural analogue of VC. Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014) introduced the DS dimension, later shown by Brukhim et al. (2022) to characterize multiclass learnability. Brukhim et al. also showed that Nat and DS can diverge arbitrarily, suggesting that multiclass learning is governed by DS rather than Nat. We show that agnostic multiclass PAC sample complexity is in fact governed by two distinct dimensions. Specifically, we prove nearly tight agnostic sample complexity bounds that, up to log factors, take the form $\\frac{DS^{1.5}}ε + \\frac{Nat}{ε^2}$ where $ε$ is the excess risk. This bound is tight up to a $\\sqrt{DS}$ factor in the first term, nearly matching known $Nat/ε^2$ and $DS/ε$ lower bounds. The first term reflects the DS-controlled regime, while the second shows that the Natarajan dimension still dictates asymptotic behavior for small $ε$. Thus, unlike binary or online classification -- where a single dimension (VC or Littlestone) controls both phenomena -- multiclass learning inherently involves two structural parameters. Our technical approach departs from traditional agnostic learning methods based on uniform convergence or reductions to realizable cases. A key ingredient is a novel online procedure based on a self-adaptive multiplicative-weights algorithm performing a label-space reduction, which may be of independent interest."}

The security of a rotatable array system is investigated in this paper. A dual-base-station (BS) architecture is adopted, in which the BSs collaboratively perform integrated sensing of the eavesdropper (the target) and communication tasks. To address the security challenge when the sensing target is located on the main communication link, the problem of maximizing the secrecy rate (SR) under sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements and discrete constraints is formulated. This problem involves the joint optimization of the array pose, the antenna distribution on the array surface, the multi-layer transmitting RIS phase matrices, and the beamforming matrices, which is non-convex. To solve this challenge, an two-stage online algorithm based on the generalized Rayleigh quotient and an offline algorithm based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient are proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared to conventional schemes without array pose adjustment, the proposed approach achieves approximately 22\\% improvement in SR.

A key finding is the critical shortcoming of conventional, coarser-resolution models under realistic shading; these are shown to overestimate the actual string operating power by up to 163% and the monthly energy yield by up to 54%. The proposed framework avoids these errors by precisely capturing mismatch losses and the time-varying phenomena of system components, such as bypass diode activations. Furthermore, the model accurately quantifies the effectiveness of mitigation technologies, showing that Module-Level Power Electronics (MLPEs) can increase the monthly energy yield of a heavily shaded string by over 20%. This research provides a crucial tool for reliable system design, accurate power forecasting, and the optimization of PV systems in complex urban settings."}

While recent work has sought to extend RoPE to higher-dimensional inputs, many such extensions are non-commutative, thereby forfeiting RoPE's shift-equivariance property. Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors. This formulation enables two key generalizations: (1) extending rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions, and (2) encoding positional information in multivectors of multiple grades, not just vectors. We present preliminary experiments comparing spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based rotary embeddings."}

This paper introduces DIGing-SGLD, a decentralized SGLD algorithm designed for scalable Bayesian learning in multi-agent systems operating over time-varying networks. Existing decentralized SGLD methods are restricted to static network topologies, and many exhibit steady-state sampling bias caused by network effects, even when full batches are used. DIGing-SGLD overcomes these limitations by integrating Langevin-based sampling with the gradient-tracking mechanism of the DIGing algorithm, originally developed for decentralized optimization over time-varying networks, thereby enabling efficient and bias-free sampling without a central coordinator. To our knowledge, we provide the first finite-time non-asymptotic Wasserstein convergence guarantees for decentralized SGLD-based sampling over time-varying networks, with explicit constants. Under standard strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, DIGing-SGLD achieves geometric convergence to an $O(\\sqrtη)$ neighborhood of the target distribution, where $η$ is the stepsize, with dependence on the target accuracy matching the best-known rates for centralized and static-network SGLD algorithms using constant stepsize. Numerical experiments on Bayesian linear and logistic regression validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the strong empirical performance of DIGing-SGLD under dynamically evolving network conditions."}

Long-range flights often trigger frequent inter-cell handovers, which may introduce delays and synchronization overhead. We jointly optimize the continuous trajectory and BS association to minimize handovers, path length, and flying time, subject to communication reliability and kinematic constraints. To address this problem, we reformulate it as an optimization based on the graph of convex sets (GCS). First, the URLLC requirement is translated into spatially feasible regions in the flight plane for each BS. And an intersection graph is constructed including the start and goal points. Each graph node is associated with a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory segment. The trajectory is parameterized in space by Bézier curves and in time by a monotonic Bézier scaling, together with convex constraints that ensure continuity and enforce speed bounds. Next, we impose unit-flow constraints to enforce a single path, and by coupling the resulting binary edge-selection variables with the convex constraints, we obtain a mixed-integer convex program (MICP). Applying a convex relaxation and rounding to the mixed-integer convex program produces nearly globally optimal routes, and a final refinement yields smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories. Simulations verify that the method preserves URLLC connectivity while achieving a clear trade-off between fewer handovers and flight efficiency."}

Sampling methods often struggle with slow or non-convergence when dealing with multiple modes or flat regions of the target distributions. This paper develops a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for non-identified models, leveraging the knowledge of observationally equivalent sets of parameters, and highlights an important role that identification plays in modern Bayesian analysis. We show that our proposal overcomes the issues of being trapped in a local mode and achieves a faster rate of convergence than the existing MCMC techniques including random walk Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The gain in the speed of convergence is more significant as the dimension or cardinality of the identified sets increases. Simulation studies show its superior performance compared to other popular computational methods including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo. We also demonstrate that our method uncovers non-trivial modes in the target distribution in a structural vector moving-average (SVMA) application."}

We investigate the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using various combinations of amplitude-based features (magnitude spectrogram, interaural level difference - ILD) and phase-based features (phase spectrogram, interaural phase difference - IPD). Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain data with mismatched head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) reveal that carefully chosen feature combinations often outperform increases in model complexity. While two-feature sets such as ILD + IPD are sufficient for in-domain SSL, generalization to diverse content requires richer inputs combining channel spectrograms with both ILD and IPD. Using the optimal feature sets, our low-complexity CNN model achieves competitive performance. Our findings underscore the importance of feature design in binaural SSL and provide practical guidance for both domain-specific and general-purpose localization."}

To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel approach that first identifies layers with rich harmful knowledge and then thoroughly eliminates the harmful knowledge via re-insertion strategy. Our method introduces knowledge density estimation to quantify and locate layers containing the most harmful knowledge, enabling precise unlearning. Additionally, we design a layer re-insertion strategy that extracts and re-inserts harmful knowledge-rich layers into the original LLM, bypassing gradient obstruction caused by cover layers and ensuring effective gradient propagation during unlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on several unlearning and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that KUnBR achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance while maintaining model utility."}

We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data. The results reveal that the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance highlights meaningful density differences related to both rate and support."}

By introducing a scalable stochastic model that implicitly accounts for 51'840 climate years, this paper identifies multi-year storage of liquid hydrocarbons as a key option for managing climate uncertainty and ensuring energy security. In Europe, multi-year storage reduces system costs by 4.1%, fossil imports by 86%, and curtailment by 60%. The benefit of multi-year storage is that a renewable surplus in one year is not curtailed but converted to synthetic oil, with hydrogen as an intermediate product, and stored to balance a future deficit. We find that the required energy capacity for liquid hydrocarbons is 525 TWh, a quarter of the European Union's current oil and gas reserves, complemented by 116 TWh for hydrogen storage. Security of supply remains high and unserved energy only amounts to 0.0035 per thousand, well below the common target of 0.02 per thousand."}

Traditional approaches use absolute sinusoidal embeddings or learned positional vectors, while more recent methods emphasize relative encodings to better capture translation equivariances. In this work, we propose RollPE, a novel positional encoding mechanism based on traveling waves, implemented by applying a circular roll operation to the query and key tensors in self-attention. This operation induces a relative shift in phase across positions, allowing the model to compute attention as a function of positional differences rather than absolute indices. We show this simple method significantly outperforms traditional absolute positional embeddings and is comparable to RoPE. We derive a continuous case of RollPE which implicitly imposes a topographic structure on the query and key space. We further derive a mathematical equivalence of RollPE to a particular configuration of RoPE. Viewing RollPE through the lens of traveling waves may allow us to simplify RoPE and relate it to processes of information flow in the brain."}

The pair (π(w), c(w)) is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates π(w) and c(w) by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform.

It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system."}

The SFL model achieved an accuracy of 0.9894 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9894, outperforming a comprehensive Random Forest (RF) baseline that used feature concatenation (Accuracy = 0.9868). Crucially, the SFL model demonstrated vastly superior reliability and calibration, exhibiting a 93% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0035) and a 2.5x lower Log Loss (0.0304) compared to the RF baseline (ECE = 0.0500; Log Loss = 0.0772). This performance validates the architectural hypothesis that non-linear gating is superior to simple feature concatenation, establishing the SFL model as a robust and trustworthy system for complex multimodal lyrical analysis."}

Building on the Optimization Monte Carlo framework, our approach reformulates stochastic simulation as deterministic optimization problems. Gradient-based methods are then applied to efficiently navigate toward high-density posterior regions and avoid wasteful simulations in low-probability areas. A JAX-based implementation further enhances the performance through vectorization of key method components.

While directly relevant to real-life operations, this problem has received very little attention in the literature. The paper proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for OTSD that represents post-contingency loss of connectivity without requiring additional binary variables. This new formulation provides the foundation for a fast, iterative heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments confirms that state-of-the-art optimization solvers struggle to solve the extensive formulation of OTSD, often failing to find even trivial solutions within reasonable time. In contrast, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristic, which finds high-quality feasible solutions 100-1000x faster than using Gurobi."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy. Starting from an extremely compressed network that satisfies hardware constraints, the method selectively regenerates critical connections to recover lost performance, effectively mitigating the sharp accuracy drop commonly observed under high sparsity conditions."}

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \\textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \\approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($Θ(\\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \\textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \\approx K$ for $K \\le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \\approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse."}

For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments."}

Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima.

However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance.

Unfortunately, the formulated problem in its original form is intractable because it is an infinite-dimensional bi-level optimization problem over a function space. To address this complexity, we develop an equivalent transformation into a tractable form as mixed-integer linear program leveraging linear dynamical system theory and graph theory. Notably, our investigation reveals that the severity of potential attacks hinges solely on the cumulative reactances over the path from the substation to the targeted node, thereby reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional problem. Further, the bi-level optimization problem is reduced to a single-level optimization problem by using a technique utilized in solving the shortest path problem.

This work introduces a \\textit{homotopy-guided self-supervised L2O method} for parametric AC-OPF problems. The key idea is to construct a continuous deformation of the objective and constraints during training, beginning from a relaxed problem with a broad basin of attraction and gradually transforming it toward the original problem.

We evaluate the proposed method on standard IEEE AC-OPF benchmarks and show that homotopy-guided L2O significantly increases feasibility rates compared to non-homotopy baselines, while achieving objective values comparable to full OPF solvers. These findings demonstrate the promise of homotopy-based heuristics for scalable, constraint-aware L2O in power system optimization."}

We formulate intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows derived from ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy with diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency settings, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid switches along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with 1204 students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for nearly all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by about 12 percentage points relative to greedy and produced more consistent difficulty alignment, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy at lower computational cost in resource-scarce environments. Slack variables localized missing content and guided targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across student subgroups.

Furthermore, designing collaborative training mechanisms within such consortia to enhance inference performance has emerged as a promising research direction. However, the cross-domain deployment of SLMs, coupled with structural heterogeneity in SLMs architectures, poses significant challenges to enhancing model performance. To this end, we propose Co-PLMs, a novel co-tuning framework for collaborative training of large and small language models, which integrates the process of structure-agnostic mutual learning to realize knowledge exchange between the heterogeneous language models. This framework employs distilled proxy models (DPMs) as bridges to enable collaborative training between the heterogeneous server-based LLM and on-device SLMs, while preserving the domain-specific insights of each device.

The analysis of rare events is a computationally challenging problem, particularly in high dimensions $d$. In this work, we develop the first asymptotic high-dimensional theory of rare events. First, we exploit asymptotic integral methods recently developed by the first author to provide an asymptotic expansion of rare event probabilities. The expansion employs the geometry of the rare event boundary and the local behavior of the log probability density. Generically, the expansion is valid if $d^2\\llλ$, where $λ$ characterizes the extremity of the event. We prove this condition is necessary by constructing an example in which the first-order remainder is bounded above and below by $d^2/λ$. We also provide a nonasymptotic remainder bound which specifies the precise dependence of the remainder on $d$, $λ$, the density, and the boundary, and which shows that in certain cases, the condition $d^2\\ll λ$ can be relaxed. As an application of the theory, we derive asymptotic approximations to rare probabilities under the standard Gaussian density in high dimensions. In the second part of our work, we provide an asymptotic approximation to densities conditional on rare events. This gives rise to simple procedure for approximately sampling conditionally on the rare event using independent Gaussian and exponential random variables."}

Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours). This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\\%) and reduced carbon footprint."}

This inquiry is motivated by recent work in the Equivariant learning literature which highlights the advantages of bi-Lipschitz models in other scenarios.\n  We consider two symmetry aware metrics on point clouds: (a) The Procrustes Matching (PM) metric and (b) Hard Gromov Wasserstien distances. We show that these two distances themselves are not bi-Lipschitz equivalent, and as a corollary deduce that popular invariant networks for point clouds are not bi-Lipschitz with respect to the PM metric. We then show how these networks can be modified so that they do obtain bi-Lipschitz guarantees. Finally, we provide initial experiments showing the advantage of the proposed bi-Lipschitz model over standard invariant models, for the tasks of finding correspondences between 3D point clouds."}

A key hurdle lies in accessing the original training data, as fine-tuning solely on new data often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose Replay Tuning (R-Tuning), a novel framework designed for the continual adaptation of pre-trained time-series models. R-Tuning constructs a unified latent space that captures both prior and current task knowledge through a frequency-aware replay strategy. Specifically, it augments model-generated samples via wavelet-based decomposition across multiple frequency bands, generating trend-preserving and fusion-enhanced variants to improve representation diversity and replay efficiency. To further reduce reliance on synthetic samples, R-Tuning introduces a latent consistency constraint that aligns new representations with the prior task space. This constraint guides joint optimization within a compact and semantically coherent latent space, ensuring robust knowledge retention and adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R-Tuning, which reduces MAE and MSE by up to 46.9% and 46.8%, respectively, on new tasks, while preserving prior knowledge with gains of up to 5.7% and 6.0% on old tasks. Notably, under few-shot settings, R-Tuning outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines even when synthetic proxy samples account for only 5% of the new task dataset."}

The proposed dual-input acoustic-image feature fusion using a hybrid ViT framework effectively models both temporal and spectral dependencies in noisy signals. Designed for real-world audio environments, the proposed framework is computationally lightweight and suitable for implementation on embedded devices. To evaluate its effectiveness, four standard and commonly used quality measurements, namely PESQ, STOI, Seg SNR, and LLR, are utilized. Experimental results obtained using the Librispeech dataset as the clean speech source and the UrbanSound8K and Google Audioset datasets as the noise sources, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves noise reduction, speech intelligibility, and perceptual quality compared to the noisy input signal, achieving performance close to the clean reference."}

In this work, we propose the Regularized Schrödinger Bridge (RSB), an adaptation of Schrödinger Bridge tailored for inverse problems that addresses the above limitations. RSB employs a novel regularized training strategy that perturbs both the input states and targets, effectively mitigating exposure bias by exposing the model to simulated prediction errors and also alleviating distortion by well-designed interpolation via the posterior mean. Extensive experiments on two typical inverse problems for speech enhancement demonstrate that RSB outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving distortion metrics and effectively reducing exposure bias."}

A powerful training-free strategy to accelerate this process is Schedule Optimization, which aims to find an optimal distribution of timesteps for a fixed and small Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to maximize sample quality. To this end, a successful schedule optimization method must adhere to four core principles: effectiveness, adaptivity, practical robustness, and computational efficiency. However, existing paradigms struggle to satisfy these principles simultaneously, motivating the need for a more advanced solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical-Schedule-Optimizer (HSO), a novel and efficient bi-level optimization framework. HSO reframes the search for a globally optimal schedule into a more tractable problem by iteratively alternating between two synergistic levels: an upper-level global search for an optimal initialization strategy and a lower-level local optimization for schedule refinement. This process is guided by two key innovations: the Midpoint Error Proxy (MEP), a solver-agnostic and numerically stable objective for effective local optimization, and the Spacing-Penalized Fitness (SPF) function, which ensures practical robustness by penalizing pathologically close timesteps. Extensive experiments show that HSO sets a new state-of-the-art for training-free sampling in the extremely low-NFE regime. For instance, with an NFE of just 5, HSO achieves a remarkable FID of 11.94 on LAION-Aesthetics with Stable Diffusion v2.1. Crucially, this level of performance is attained not through costly retraining, but with a one-time optimization cost of less than 8 seconds, presenting a highly practical and efficient paradigm for diffusion model acceleration."}

Inspired by the physical root of the problem, the spatial misalignment of RGB color channels due to lens dispersion, we introduce a novel Chromatic-Aware Coordinate Transformation (CA-CT) module, learning an image-adaptive color space to decouple and isolate fringing into a dedicated dimension. This targeted separation allows the network to learn a precise ``purple fringe channel\", which then guides the accurate restoration of the luminance channel. The final color correction is performed by a learned 5D Look-Up Table (5D LUT), enabling efficient and powerful% non-linear color mapping.

In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias.

Moreover, the involved binomial matrix multiplication operation is decomposed into 4 groups of bit-serial shifting and additions, without costly physical multipliers in the CIM. We maximize the energy efficiency of the CIM circuit through zero-value bit-skipping, data-driven word line activation, read-write separate 6T cells and bit-alternating 14T/28T adders.

Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set. However, the theoretical interaction between SI-based rejuvenation kernels and KLD-based adaptive sampling is not yet fully understood.\n  This paper investigates this specific interaction. We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.\n  By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \\emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters."}

Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings."}

Challenges arise when the system's modes are characterized by unobservable (latent) parameters and the events that cause system dynamics to switch between different modes are also unobservable. Model-based control approaches typically do not account for such uncertainty in the hybrid dynamics, while standard model-free RL methods fail to account for abrupt mode switches, leading to poor generalization.\n  To overcome this, we propose SAC-MoE which models the actor of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a learned router that adaptively selects among learned experts. To further improve robustness, we develop a curriculum-based training algorithm to prioritize data collection in challenging settings, allowing better generalization to unseen modes and switching locations. Simulation studies in hybrid autonomous racing and legged locomotion tasks show that SAC-MoE outperforms baselines (up to 6x) in zero-shot generalization to unseen environments. Our curriculum strategy consistently improves performance across all evaluated policies. Qualitative analysis shows that the interpretable MoE router activates different experts for distinct latent modes."}

Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, enabling them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems.

We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting.

A 2R manipulator tracking a circular end-effector path is first examined because this case has a known analytical optimum: equal link lengths and the second joint orthogonal to the first. This serves as a validation step to test whether RL can rediscover the optimum using reward feedback alone, without access to the manipulability expression or the Jacobian. Three RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG, and PPO) are compared with grid search and black-box optimizers, with morphology represented by a single action parameter phi that maps to the link lengths. All methods converge to the analytical solution, showing that numerical recovery of the optimum is possible without supplying analytical structure.\n  Most morphology design tasks have no closed-form solutions, and grid or heuristic search becomes expensive as dimensionality increases. RL is therefore explored as a scalable alternative. The formulation used for the circular path is extended to elliptical and rectangular paths by expanding the action space to the full morphology vector (L1, L2, theta2). In these non-analytical settings, RL continues to converge reliably, whereas grid and black-box methods require far larger evaluation budgets. These results indicate that RL is effective for both recovering known optima and solving morphology optimization problems without analytical solutions."}

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions."}

Within the family of MLP-based NN1 variants we evaluated, consolidation effectiveness is driven more by methodology than architectural embellishments -- a simple MLP outperforms more complex similarity-gated variants by 1.2pp. Through systematic hyperparameter analysis, we observed empirically that pure replay without distillation during consolidation achieves superior performance, consistent with the hypothesis that distillation from the fast network introduces recency bias. On Split-MNIST (30 seeds), FSC-Net achieves 91.71% +/- 0.62% retention accuracy, a +4.27pp gain over the fast network alone (87.43% +/- 1.27%, paired t=23.585, p < 1e-10). On Split-CIFAR-10 (5 seeds), our method achieves 33.31% +/- 0.38% retention with an +8.20pp gain over the fast network alone (25.11% +/- 1.61%, paired t=9.75, p < 1e-3), demonstrating +8.20pp gain, though absolute performance (33.31%) remains modest and below random expectation, highlighting need for stronger backbones. Our results provide empirical evidence that the dual-timescale consolidation mechanism, rather than architectural complexity, is central to mitigating catastrophic forgetting in this setting."}

This task is further complicated by low-light conditions, partial occlusion, small object size, intricate background patterns, and multiple objects. While many sophisticated methods have been proposed for this task, current methods still struggle to precisely detect camouflaged objects in complex scenarios, especially with small and multiple objects, indicating room for improvement. We propose a Multi-Scale Recursive Network that extracts multi-scale features via a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone and combines them via specialized Attention-Based Scale Integration Units, enabling selective feature merging. For more precise object detection, our decoder recursively refines features by incorporating Multi-Granularity Fusion Units. A novel recursive-feedback decoding strategy is developed to enhance global context understanding, helping the model overcome the challenges in this task. By jointly leveraging multi-scale learning and recursive feature optimization, our proposed method achieves performance gains, successfully detecting small and multiple camouflaged objects.

In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability."}

Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems."}

However, the representation of older adults, an increasingly important demographic in healthcare, in existing MoCap locomotion datasets has not been thoroughly examined. This work surveyed 41 publicly available datasets, identifying eight that include older adult motions and four that contain motions performed by younger actors annotated as old style. Older adults represent a small portion of participants overall, and few datasets provide full-body motion data for this group. To assess the fidelity of old-style walking motions, quantitative metrics are introduced, defining high fidelity as the ability to capture age-related differences relative to normative walking. Using gait parameters that are age-sensitive, robust to noise, and resilient to data scarcity, we found that old-style walking motions often exhibit overly controlled patterns and fail to faithfully characterize aging. These findings highlight the need for improved representation of older adults in motion datasets and establish a method to quantitatively evaluate the quality of old-style walking motions."}

However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments.

To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $ε$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR.

Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths."}

Despite the computation and communication efficiency of these systems, due to limited computation resources on edge devices, relying on more computationally rich systems on the cloud side is inevitable in most cases. Cloud inference systems can achieve the best performance while the computation and communication cost is dramatically increasing by the expansion of a number of edge devices relying on these systems. Hence, there is a trade-off between the computation, communication, and performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed as Eccentric that learns models with different levels of trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. This framework, based on an adaptation of knowledge from the edge model to the cloud one, reduces the computation and communication costs of the system during inference while achieving the best performance possible. The Eccentric framework can be considered as a new form of compression method suited for edge-cloud inference systems to reduce both computation and communication costs. Empirical studies on classification and object detection tasks corroborate the efficacy of this framework."}

This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large. Finally, we devise an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity. Moreover, equipping the transceivers with pixel antennas can enhance the achievable rate of MIMO communications."}

However, segmentation foundation models deteriorate quickly under weather, lighting, and viewpoint drift. Resource-limited UAVs cannot run gradient-based test-time adaptation, while resource-massive UAVs adapt independently, wasting shared experience. To address these challenges, we propose AdaptFly, a prompt-guided test-time adaptation framework that adjusts segmentation models without weight updates. AdaptFly features two complementary adaptation modes. For resource-limited UAVs, it employs lightweight token-prompt retrieval from a shared global memory. For resource-massive UAVs, it uses gradient-free sparse visual prompt optimization via Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. An activation-statistic detector triggers adaptation, while cross-UAV knowledge pool consolidates prompt knowledge and enables fleet-wide collaboration with negligible bandwidth overhead. Extensive experiments on UAVid and VDD benchmarks, along with real-world UAV deployments under diverse weather conditions, demonstrate that AdaptFly significantly improves segmentation accuracy and robustness over static models and state-of-the-art TTA baselines. The results highlight a practical path to resilient, communication-efficient perception in the emerging low-altitude economy."}

For compact safe sets, we derive an explicit lower bound on the smoothing parameter that makes the smooth function a CBF and hence renders the corresponding safety filter feasible. For unbounded sets, we introduce tail conditions under which the smooth function satisfies an extended CBF condition uniformly. Finally, we apply these results to backup CBFs. We show that safety of a compact (terminal) backup set under a backup controller, together with a condition ensuring safety of the backup trajectories on the relevant boundary of the safe set, is sufficient for feasibility for backup CBFs. These results provide a recipe for a priori feasibility guarantees for smooth inner approximations of nonsmooth safe sets without the need for additional online certification."}

To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\\% on spontaneous and 4.8\\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\\% and 18.26\\%, providing reference points for future improvements.

In this increasingly competitive environment, many small and medium sized enterprises struggle to maintain customer satisfaction as rivals deliver higher quality services at lower cost. This study addresses the absence of robust measurement systems for assessing service quality, a key factor underlying customer attrition, by proposing an integrated framework for evaluating satisfaction and identifying sources of dissatisfaction in computer services.\n  The framework combines core principles of Six Sigma with the SERVQUAL instrument within a structured DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). SERVQUAL provides the service quality dimensions and gap analysis techniques, while Six Sigma supplies the data driven approach to measurement and improvement. The literature suggests limited prior work integrating Lean Six Sigma with SERVQUAL, and this study contributes by operationalizing that integration in a real world setting.\n  A case study of a computer services company was conducted to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness. Satisfaction levels were quantified, and root causes of dissatisfaction were identified. The analysis revealed a low overall satisfaction level and five primary drivers of unmet customer requirements. Addressing these causes is expected to increase customer satisfaction, lower customer acquisition costs, and improve overall organizational performance."}

A Computational Study with Infant Egocentric Video", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Typically, children start to learn their first words between 6 and 9 months, linking spoken utterances to their visual referents. Without prior knowledge, a word encountered for the first time can be interpreted in countless ways; it might refer to any of the objects in the environment, their components, or attributes. Using longitudinal, egocentric, and ecologically valid data from the experience of one child, in this work, we propose a self-supervised and biologically plausible strategy to learn strong visual representations. Our masked autoencoder-based visual backbone incorporates knowledge about the blind spot in human eyes to define a novel masking strategy. This mask and reconstruct approach attempts to mimic the way the human brain fills the gaps in the eyes' field of view. This represents a significant shift from standard random masking strategies, which are difficult to justify from a biological perspective. The pretrained encoder is utilized in a contrastive learning-based video-text model capable of acquiring word-referent mappings. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed biologically plausible masking strategy is at least as effective as random masking for learning word-referent mappings from cross-situational and temporally extended episodes."}

PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode."}

While spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics capture molecular features, they lack pathological morphological context. Integrating these omics with histopathological images is therefore essential for comprehensive disease tissue analysis. However, substantial heterogeneity across omics, imaging, and spatial modalities poses significant challenges. Naive fusion of semantically distinct sources often leads to ambiguous representations. Additionally, the resolution mismatch between high-resolution histology images and lower-resolution sequencing spots complicates spatial alignment. Biological perturbations during sample preparation further distort modality-specific signals, hindering accurate integration. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-guided Representation of Omics and Vision with Expert Regulation for Adaptive Spatial Multi-omics Fusion (GROVER), a novel framework for adaptive integration of spatial multi-omics data. GROVER leverages a Graph Convolutional Network encoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to capture the nonlinear dependencies between each modality and its associated spatial structure, thereby producing expressive, modality-specific embeddings. To align these representations, we introduce a spot-feature-pair contrastive learning strategy that explicitly optimizes the correspondence across modalities at each spot. Furthermore, we design a dynamic expert routing mechanism that adaptively selects informative modalities for each spot while suppressing noisy or low-quality inputs. Experiments on real-world spatial omics datasets demonstrate that GROVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing a robust and reliable solution for multimodal integration."}

We further introduce an adaptive speculative verification strategy that adjusts acceptance thresholds by token-level semantic importance, delivering an additional 15% to 20% end-to-end speedup without retraining. In theory, DSD reduces cross-node communication cost by approximately (N-1)t1(k-1)/k, where t1 is per-link latency and k is the average number of tokens accepted per round. In practice, DSD achieves up to 2.56x speedup on HumanEval and 2.59x on GSM8K, surpassing the Eagle3 baseline while preserving accuracy. These results show that adapting speculative decoding for decentralized execution provides a system-level optimization that converts network stalls into throughput, enabling faster distributed LLM inference with no model retraining or architectural changes."}

We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics."}

To address this, we propose DK-Root, a joint data-and-knowledge-driven framework that unifies scalable weak supervision with precise expert guidance for robust root-cause analysis. DK-Root first pretrains an encoder via contrastive representation learning using abundant rule-based labels while explicitly denoising their noise through a supervised contrastive objective. To supply task-faithful data augmentation, we introduce a class-conditional diffusion model that generates KPIs sequences preserving root-cause semantics, and by controlling reverse diffusion steps, it produces weak and strong augmentations that improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods. Ablations confirm the necessity of the conditional diffusion augmentation and the pretrain-finetune design, validating both representation quality and classification gains."}

These findings, derived from behavioral data and problem vignettes across complexity levels, indicate that the fundamental constraint on reliable AI-assisted work is solution validation rather than generation.

The higher the burden of any tax system, the costlier for society, as taxpayers are unable to engage in proper wealth creation when being kept busy with administrative tax work. This research finds evidence for a relationship between hours spent to comply with taxes and amount of tax payment. These findings help better understand tax administrative costs and ultimately may help reduce them. PwC and World Bank's final \"Paying taxes\"-publication (2019) contains tax data for most of the world's jurisdictions, in particular annual hours spent to comply with tax obligations (X) and annual amount of tax payments (Y), both for the year 2019. X and Y were plotted in 6 tests. A positive slope, satisfying p and r values, high mutual information and finally a conclusive scatter plot picture were the 5 requirements that all needed to be met to confirm a positive relationship between X and Y. The first 2 tests did not make any adjustments to the data, the next 2 tests removed cities --thereby avoiding the double counting of jurisdictions-- and the final 2 tests removed cities and outliers. Each test pair uses for Y first total number of payments; and for each second test the number of other payments, which excludes income tax payments for profit and labour. All 5 requirements were met in every of the 6 tests, indicating a positive dependence. In addition, 4 confirmatory tests validate the methodology. The found relationship is noticeably stronger for the total number of tax payments. Findings indicate that taxpayers' time spent on tax, and thereby society's overall tax administrative costs, could be reduced by simplifying taxation processes, including tax collection and payments."}

We present a curiosity-driven quantized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses both through Bayesian epistemic uncertainty-based routing across heterogeneous experts (BitNet ternary, 1-16 bit BitLinear, post-training quantization). Evaluated on audio classification benchmarks (ESC-50, Quinn, UrbanSound8K), our 4-bit quantization maintains 99.9 percent of 16-bit accuracy (0.858 vs 0.859 F1) with 4x compression and 41 percent energy savings versus 8-bit. Crucially, curiosity-driven routing reduces MoE latency variance by 82 percent (p = 0.008, Levene's test) from 230 ms to 29 ms standard deviation, enabling stable inference for battery-constrained devices. Statistical analysis confirms 4-bit/8-bit achieve practical equivalence with full precision (p > 0.05), while MoE architectures introduce 11 percent latency overhead (p < 0.001) without accuracy gains. At scale, deployment emissions dominate training by 10000x for models serving more than 1,000 inferences, making inference efficiency critical. Our information-theoretic routing demonstrates that adaptive quantization yields accurate (0.858 F1, 1.2M params), energy-efficient (3.87 F1/mJ), and predictable edge models, with simple 4-bit quantized architectures outperforming complex MoE for most deployments."}

However, distribution shifts arising from the complex and dynamic nature of TC environmental fields, such as varying geographical conditions and seasonal changes, present significant challenges to reliable estimation. Most existing methods rely on multi-modal fusion for feature extraction but overlook the intrinsic distribution of feature representations, leading to poor generalization under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL."}

Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%."}

In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud.

Yet, the cost of adopting these AI services is understudied. Unlike traditional software licensing in which costs are predictable before usage, commercial LLM services charge per token of input text in addition to generated output tokens. Crucially, while firms can control the input, they have limited control over output tokens, which are effectively set by generation dynamics outside of business control. This research shows that subtle shifts in linguistic style can systematically alter the number of output tokens without impacting response quality. Using an experiment with OpenAI's API, this study reveals that non-polite prompts significantly increase output tokens leading to higher enterprise costs and additional revenue for OpenAI. Politeness is merely one instance of a broader phenomenon in which linguistic structure can drive unpredictable cost variation. For enterprises integrating LLM into applications, this unpredictability complicates budgeting and undermines transparency in business-to-business contexts. By demonstrating how end-user behavior links to enterprise costs through output token counts, this work highlights the opacity of current pricing models and calls for new approaches to ensure predictable and transparent adoption of LLM services."}

Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. In this paper, we try to circumvent these issues by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach enables a balance between fairness and accuracy. To further facilitate this balance, we propose an adaptive penalty update mechanism that dynamically adjusts fairness constraints during the model training. We conduct numerical experiments on two real-world college admissions datasets, across three different optimization strategies. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of KANs by consistently outperforming the baseline fair learning models, and maintaining high predictive accuracy while achieving competitive fairness across sensitive attributes."}

This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer.

In large or low-resource courses, instructors often lack the time, staffing, and bandwidth required to review and respond to every student reflection, creating gaps in support precisely where learners would benefit most. This paper presents a theory-grounded system that uses five coordinated role-based LLM agents (Evaluator, Equity Monitor, Metacognitive Coach, Aggregator, and Reflexion Reviewer) to score learner reflections with a shared rubric and to generate short, bias-aware, learner-facing comments. The agents first produce structured rubric scores, then check for potentially biased or exclusionary language, add metacognitive prompts that invite students to think about their own thinking, and finally compose a concise feedback message of at most 120 words. The system includes simple fairness checks that compare scoring error across lower and higher scoring learners, enabling instructors to monitor and bound disparities in accuracy. We evaluate the pipeline in a 12-session AI literacy program with adult learners. In this setting, the system produces rubric scores that approach expert-level agreement, and trained graders rate the AI-generated comments as helpful, empathetic, and well aligned with instructional goals. Taken together, these results show that multi-agent LLM systems can deliver equitable, high-quality formative feedback at a scale and speed that would be impossible for human graders alone. More broadly, the work points toward a future where feedback-rich learning becomes feasible for any course size or context, advancing long-standing goals of equity, access, and instructional capacity in education."}

Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks."}

Most existing FL approaches assume clients possess labeled data, however, in real-world scenarios, client-side labels are often unavailable. Semi-supervised Federated learning, where only the server holds labeled data, addresses this issue. However, it experiences significant performance degradation as the number of labeled data decreases. To tackle this problem, we propose \\textit{CATCHFed}, which introduces client-aware adaptive thresholds considering class difficulty, hybrid thresholds to enhance pseudo-label quality, and utilizes unpseudo-labeled data for consistency regularization. Extensive experiments across various datasets and configurations demonstrate that CATCHFed effectively leverages unlabeled client data, achieving superior performance even in extremely limited-label settings."}

Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem.\n  This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement.\n  The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance. The framework thus provides a data-driven tool for deploying cost-effective and highly specialized multi-agent AI systems."}

This paper presents a systematic investigation into persona-induced biases in multi-agent interactions, with a focus on social traits like trustworthiness (how an agent's opinion is received by others) and insistence (how strongly an agent advocates for its opinion). Through a series of controlled experiments in collaborative problem-solving and persuasion tasks, we reveal that (1) LLM-based agents exhibit biases in both trustworthiness and insistence, with personas from historically advantaged groups (e.g., men and White individuals) perceived as less trustworthy and demonstrating less insistence; and (2) agents exhibit significant in-group favoritism, showing a higher tendency to conform to others who share the same persona. These biases persist across various LLMs, group sizes, and numbers of interaction rounds, highlighting an urgent need for awareness and mitigation to ensure the fairness and reliability of multi-agent systems."}

My results suggest that models rely on different moral foundations from one another and from a nationally representative human baseline, and these differences increase as model capabilities increase. This work seeks to spur further analysis of LLMs using MFT, including finetuning of open-source models, and greater deliberation by policymakers on the importance of moral foundations for LLM alignment."}

Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows."}

We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \\textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are \"statistical pattern matchers\"\" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency. This distinction is fundamental to how epistemic uncertainty is evaluated in LMs. We invite a discussion on the importance of how the computational processes of the systems we build and analyze in NLP research are described."}

This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse."}

The loss function and the class itself induce a simplicial structure on this space, with respect to which we define a simplicial covering dimension.\n  We prove that for finite concept classes, this simplicial covering dimension exactly characterizes the list replicability number (equivalently, global stability) in PAC learning.

To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability.

This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool.

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception.

Specifically, VC is defined as the average squared log-ratio of adjacent certainty values, capturing local fluctuations in model output smoothness. We evaluate VC as a proxy for classification accuracy and as an indicator of adversarial drift. Experiments are conducted on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on MNIST, as well as a regularized VGG-like model trained on CIFAR-10. Adversarial examples are generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) across varying perturbation magnitudes. In addition, mixed test sets are created by gradually introducing adversarial contamination to assess VC's sensitivity under incremental distribution shifts. Our results reveal a strong negative correlation between classification accuracy and log(VC) (correlation rho < -0.90 in most cases), suggesting that VC effectively reflects performance degradation without requiring labeled data.

A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs.

Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security."}

Given a batch of tasks each requesting one or more data items, where both tasks and data are distributed across multiple machines, each task must get co-located with its target data (by moving tasks and/or data) and executed. We present TD-Orch, an efficient and scalable orchestration framework featuring a simple application developer interface. TD-Orch employs a distributed push-pull technique, leveraging the bidirectional f low of both tasks and data to achieve scalable load balance across machines even under highly skewed data request (data hot spots), with minimal communication overhead. Experimental results show that TD-Orch achieves up to 2.7x speedup over existing distributed scheduling baselines. Building on TD-Orch, we present TDO-GP, a distributed graph processing system for general graph problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the underlying framework. We design three families of implementation techniques to fully leverage the execution flow provided by TD-Orch. Experimental results show that TDO-GP achieves an average speedup of 4.1x over the best prior open-source distributed graph systems for general graph processing."}

This paper presents an Autonomous Underwater Cognitive System (AUCS) that integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a Soar-based cognitive architecture to enable adaptive navigation in complex oceanic conditions. The system fuses multi-sensor data from SONAR, LiDAR, IMU, and DVL with cognitive reasoning modules for perception, attention, planning, and learning. Unlike conventional SLAM systems, AUCS incorporates semantic understanding, adaptive sensor management, and memory-based learning to differentiate between dynamic and static objects, reducing false loop closures and enhancing long-term map consistency. The proposed architecture demonstrates a complete perception-cognition-action-learning loop, allowing autonomous underwater vehicles to sense, reason, and adapt intelligently. This work lays a foundation for next-generation cognitive submersible systems, improving safety, reliability, and autonomy in deep-sea exploration."}

Industry 5.0 reorients the prevailing manufacturing paradigm toward more human-centric operations. Using a design science research methodology, we identify three essential requirements for next-generation safety training systems: high accuracy, low latency, and low cost. We introduce a multimodal chatbot powered by large language models that meets these design requirements. The chatbot uses retrieval-augmented generation to ground its responses in curated regulatory and technical documentation. To evaluate our solution, we developed a domain-specific benchmark of expert-validated question and answer pairs for three representative machines: a Bridgeport manual mill, a Haas TL-1 CNC lathe, and a Universal Robots UR5e collaborative robot. We tested 24 RAG configurations using a full-factorial design and assessed them with automated evaluations of correctness, latency, and cost. Our top 2 configurations were then evaluated by ten industry experts and academic researchers. Our results show that retrieval strategy and model configuration have a significant impact on performance. The top configuration (selected for chatbot deployment) achieved an accuracy of 86.66%, an average latency of 10.04 seconds, and an average cost of $0.005 per query.

To address this issue, we present MergeGuard, a proactive dual-stage weight protection framework that disrupts merging compatibility while maintaining task fidelity. In the first stage, we redistribute task-relevant information across layers via L2-regularized optimization, ensuring that important gradients are evenly dispersed. In the second stage, we inject structured perturbations to misalign task subspaces, breaking curvature compatibility in the loss landscape. Together, these stages reshape the model's parameter geometry such that merged models collapse into destructive interference while the protected model remains fully functional. Extensive experiments on both vision (ViT-L-14) and language (Llama2, Gemma2, Mistral) models demonstrate that MergeGuard reduces merged model accuracy by up to 90% with less than 1.5% performance loss on the protected model."}

The framework enables the extraction of high-level and low-level concepts conveyed through the narrative. Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, our approach applies a custom lexicon built with the LabMTsimple storylab module.

To address this challenge, we introduce FocusSDF, a novel loss function based on the signed distance functions (SDFs), which redirects the network to concentrate on boundary regions by adaptively assigning higher weights to pixels closer to the lesion or organ boundary, effectively making it boundary aware. To rigorously validate FocusSDF, we perform extensive evaluations against five state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models, including the foundation model MedSAM, using four distance-based loss functions across diverse datasets covering cerebral aneurysm, stroke, liver, and breast tumor segmentation tasks spanning multiple imaging modalities.

The conjugate direction field (CDF) defined on the freeform surface plays a significant role in generating a PQ mesh, as it largely determines the PQ mesh layout. Conventionally, a CDF is obtained by solving a complex non-linear optimization problem that incorporates user preferences, i.e., aligning the CDF with user-specified strokes on the surface. This often requires a large number of iterations that are computationally expensive, preventing the interactive CDF design process for a desirable PQ mesh. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks for controlled CDF generation. Our approach can effectively learn and fuse features from the freeform surface and the user strokes, and efficiently generate quality CDF respecting user guidance. To enable training and testing, we also present a dataset composed of 50000+ freeform surfaces with ground-truth CDFs, as well as a set of metrics for quantitative evaluation.

This paper introduces a leakage-aware data layer for student trajectory analytics, which serves as the methodological foundation for the CAPIRE framework for multilevel modelling. We propose a feature engineering design that organizes predictors into four levels: N1 (personal and socio-economic attributes), N2 (entry moment and academic history), N3 (curricular friction and performance), and N4 (institutional and macro-context variables)As a core component, we formalize the Value of Observation Time (VOT) as a critical design parameter that rigorously separates observation windows from outcome horizons, preventing data leakage by construction. An illustrative application in a long-cycle engineering program (1,343 students, ~57% dropout) demonstrates that VOT-restricted multilevel features support robust archetype discovery. A UMAP + DBSCAN pipeline uncovers 13 trajectory archetypes, including profiles of \"early structural crisis,\" \"sustained friction,\" and \"hidden vulnerability\" (low friction but high dropout). Bootstrap and permutation tests confirm these archetypes are statistically robust and temporally stable. We argue that this approach transforms feature engineering from a technical step into a central methodological artifact. This data layer serves as a disciplined bridge between retention theory, early-warning systems, and the future implementation of causal inference and agent-based modelling (ABM) within the CAPIRE program."}

Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures.

Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble."}

Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency.

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions through 24/7 availability and non-judgmental interactions, pre-trained models often lack the contextual and emotional awareness necessary for appropriate therapeutic responses. This paper investigated the application of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance GPT-2's capacity for therapeutic dialogue generation. The methodology restructured input formats to enable simultaneous processing of contextual information and emotional states alongside user input, employing a multi-component reward function that aligned model outputs with professional therapist responses and annotated emotions. Results demonstrated improvements through reinforcement learning over baseline GPT-2 across multiple evaluation metrics: BLEU (0.0111), ROUGE-1 (0.1397), ROUGE-2 (0.0213), ROUGE-L (0.1317), and METEOR (0.0581). LLM evaluation confirmed high contextual relevance and professionalism, while reinforcement learning achieved 99.34% emotion accuracy compared to 66.96% for baseline GPT-2. These findings demonstrate reinforcement learning's effectiveness in developing therapeutic dialogue systems that can serve as valuable assistive tools for therapists while maintaining essential human clinical oversight."}

At the same time, Large Language Models offer a new interface for exploring IoT data - particularly through natural language. Users today face two key challenges when working with IoT data using LLMs: (1) data collection infrastructure is expensive, producing terabytes of low-level sensor readings that are too granular for direct use, and (2) data analysis is slow, requiring iterative effort and technical expertise. Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies. What is missing is a system that first parses a user's query to identify the analytical task, then selects the relevant data slices, and finally chooses the right representation before invoking an LLM.\n  We present Flash-Fusion, an end-to-end edge-cloud system that reduces the IoT data collection and analysis burden on users. Two principles guide its design: (1) edge-based statistical summarization (achieving 73.5% data reduction) to address data volume, and (2) cloud-based query planning that clusters behavioral data and assembles context-rich prompts to address data interpretation. We deploy Flash-Fusion on a university bus fleet and evaluate it against a baseline that feeds raw data to a state-of-the-art LLM. Flash-Fusion achieves a 95% latency reduction and 98% decrease in token usage and cost while maintaining high-quality responses.

Counterfactual explanations are widely used to provide actionable \"what-if\" recourse, but they typically remain instance-specific and do not quantify which features systematically drive outcome changes within coherent regions of the feature space or across an entire dataset. We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss. FLEX thus bridges the gap between local recourse and global attribution, supporting transparent and intervention-oriented decision-making in risk-sensitive applications."}

Diffusion-based models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have recently shown promise by performing stochastic search in a continuous latent space that compactly captures molecular semantics. Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process."}

These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making.

Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs.

As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems."}

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained.

We introduce an enhanced UGLMS that delivers significantly faster test runtimes while maintaining estimation accuracy. First, a rank-1 EKF update replaces costly matrix inversions with efficient vector operations, and a measurement-aligned covariance-inflation strategy accelerates convergence under unexpected innovations. Second, we extend the static mismatch model with a low-order carrier polynomial to capture systematic nonlinearities beyond pure capacitor mismatch. Third, a trace-based termination adapts test length to convergence, preventing premature stops and redundant iterations. Simulations show the enhanced UGLMS reconstructs full Integral- and Differential-Non-Linearity (INL/DNL) in just 36 ms for 16-bit and under 70 ms for 18-bit ADCs (120 ms with the polynomial extension). Combining the faster convergence from covariance inflation with reduced per-iteration runtime from the rank-1 EKF update, the method reaches equal accuracy 8x faster for 16-bit ADCs.

To address this challenge, we introduce \\textbf{CALM}, short for \\textbf{Classification with Additive Large Language Models}, an interpretable framework for semi-structured text where inputs are composed of semantically meaningful components, such as sections of an admission note or question-answer fields from an intake form. CALM predicts outcomes as the additive sum of each component's contribution, making these contributions part of the forward computation itself and enabling faithful explanations at both the patient and population level. The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate. Although CALM expects semi-structured inputs, many clinical documents already have this form, and similar structure can often be automatically extracted from free-text notes. CALM achieves performance comparable to conventional LLM classifiers while improving trust, supporting quality-assurance checks, and revealing clinically meaningful patterns during model development and auditing."}

The performance of GNNs relies crucially on the availability of informative node features, which can be limited or absent in real-life datasets and applications. A natural remedy is to augment the node features with embeddings computed from eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets that feature augmentation via ILEs can improve performance across commonly used GNN architectures. Our work offers a straightforward and practical approach that broadens the practitioner's spectral augmentation toolkit when node features are limited."}

However, existing XR spatial audio rendering methods often struggle with real-time adaptation to diverse physical scenes, causing a sensory mismatch between visual and auditory cues that disrupts user immersion. To address this, we introduce SAMOSA, a novel on-device system that renders spatially accurate sound by dynamically adapting to its physical environment. SAMOSA leverages a synergistic multimodal scene representation by fusing real-time estimations of room geometry, surface materials, and semantic-driven acoustic context. This rich representation then enables efficient acoustic calibration via scene priors, allowing the system to synthesize a highly realistic Room Impulse Response (RIR). We validate our system through technical evaluation using acoustic metrics for RIR synthesis across various room configurations and sound types, alongside an expert evaluation (N=12). Evaluation results demonstrate SAMOSA's feasibility and efficacy in enhancing XR auditory realism."}

The policy enables agent control without prior knowledge of target numbers, states, or dynamics. Effective target tracking demands balancing exploration for undetected or lost targets with following the motion of detected but uncertain ones. We generate a demonstration dataset from three expert planners including frontier-based exploration, an uncertainty-based hybrid planner switching between frontier-based exploration and RRT* tracking based on target uncertainty, and a time-based hybrid planner switching between exploration and tracking based on target detection time. We design a control policy utilizing a vision transformer for egocentric map tokenization and an attention mechanism to integrate variable target estimates represented by Gaussian densities. Trained as a diffusion model, the policy learns to generate multi-modal action sequences through a denoising process. Evaluations demonstrate MATT-Diff's superior tracking performance against expert and behavior cloning baselines across multiple target motions, empirically validating its advantages in target tracking."}

However, when applied to sensitive data, this approach poses significant security risks. To address this issue, we propose a security-motivated alternative: restrict LLMs from direct code generation and data access, and require them to interact with data exclusively through a predefined set of secure, verified tools. Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%). These results show that current LLMs still lack robust multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. With InData, we take a step toward enabling the development and evaluation of LLMs with stronger multi-step tool-use capabilities. We will publicly release the dataset and code."}

Experiments cover two representation paradigms: CNNs trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors. These results support a representation-centric view of OOD detection and provide statistically grounded guidance for method selection under distribution shift."}

SurvBench provides data loaders for three major critical care databases, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and MC-MED, supporting diverse modalities including time-series vitals, static demographics, ICD diagnosis codes, and radiology reports. The pipeline implements rigorous data quality controls, patient-level splitting to prevent data leakage, explicit missingness tracking, and standardised temporal aggregation. SurvBench handles both single-risk (e.g., in-hospital mortality) and competing-risks scenarios (e.g., multiple discharge outcomes). The outputs are compatible with pycox library packages and implementations of standard statistical and deep learning models.

The tension between these two mindsets makes modular programming error prone. Functions that encapsulate collective operations, despite being called per-thread, must be executed cooperatively by groups of threads.\n  In this work, we introduce Prism, a new GPU language that restores modularity while still giving programmers the low-level control over collective operations necessary for high performance. Our core idea is typed perspectives, which materialize, at the type level, the granularity at which the programmer is controlling the behavior of threads. We describe the design of Prism, implement a compiler for it, and lay its theoretical foundations in a core calculus called Bundl. We implement state-of-the-art GPU kernels in Prism and find that it offers programmers the safety guarantees needed to confidently write modular code without sacrificing performance."}

Completed in April 2025", "summary": "Clear imaging under hazy conditions is a critical task. Prior-based and neural methods have improved results. However, they operate on RGB frames, which suffer from limited dynamic range. Therefore, dehazing remains ill-posed and can erase structure and illumination details. To address this, we use event cameras for dehazing for the \\textbf{first time}. Event cameras offer much higher HDR ($120 dBvs.60 dB$) and microsecond latency, therefore they suit hazy scenes. In practice, transferring HDR cues from events to frames is hard because real paired data are scarce. To tackle this, we propose an event-guided diffusion model that utilizes the strong generative priors of diffusion models to reconstruct clear images from hazy inputs by effectively transferring HDR information from events. Specifically, we design an event-guided module that maps sparse HDR event features, \\textit{e.g.,} edges, corners, into the diffusion latent space. This clear conditioning provides precise structural guidance during generation, improves visual realism, and reduces semantic drift. For real-world evaluation, we collect a drone dataset in heavy haze (AQI = 341) with synchronized RGB and event sensors. Experiments on two benchmarks and our dataset achieve state-of-the-art results."}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of \"climate outlier events\". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios). The focal climate-change domain used relies on predicting grass growth on Irish dairy farms, during Europe-wide drought and forage crisis of 2018."}

To address this, we propose FedBacys, a battery-aware EHFL framework using cyclic client participation based on users' battery levels. By clustering clients and scheduling them sequentially, FedBacys minimizes redundant computations, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability.

We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.\n  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.\n  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.\n  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection."}

Moving beyond this, this study investigates the structured, grounded perspectives of a key stakeholder group: university educators. It proposes a novel theoretical model that conceptualizes the educational environment as a \"Learning Space\" composed of seven subspaces to systematically identify the impact of AI integration. This framework was operationalized through a quantitative survey of 140 Russian university educators, with responses analyzed using a binary flagging system to measure acceptance across key indicators. The results reveal a strong but conditional consensus: a majority of educators support ChatGPT's integration, contingent upon crucial factors such as the transformation of assessment methods and the availability of plagiarism detection tools. However, significant concerns persist regarding its impact on critical thinking. Educators largely reject the notion that AI diminishes their importance, viewing their role as evolving from information-deliverer to facilitator of critical engagement. The study concludes that ChatGPT acts less as a destroyer of education and more as a catalyst for its necessary evolution, and proposes the PIPE Model (Pedagogy, Infrastructure, Policy, Education) as a strategic framework for its responsible integration. This research provides a data-driven, model-based analysis of educator attitudes, offering a nuanced alternative to the polarized discourse surrounding AI in education."}

Our framework operates in a dynamic closed-loop: it first performs real-time psychological profiling of the users' state, then adaptively selects an optimized communication strategy, and finally maintains stealthiness through prompt-based rewriting. We validated this framework through a user study (N=84), demonstrating its generalizability across 3 distinct LLMs and 3 scenarios. The targeted attacks achieved a 205.4% increase in eliciting specific targeted information compared to stealthy interactions without strategies. Even stealthy interactions without specific strategies successfully elicited private information in 54.8% cases. Notably, users not only failed to detect the manipulation but paradoxically rated the attacking chatbot as more empathetic and trustworthy. Finally, we advocate for mitigations, encouraging developers to integrate adaptive, just-in-time alerts, users to build literacy against specific manipulative tactics, and regulators to define clear ethical boundaries distinguishing benign persuasion from coercion."}

Recent works show that pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) can achieve excellent performance. However, existing methods by fine-tuning node representations at large scales demand significant computational resources. Additionally, the long-tail distribution of degrees leads to insufficient representations for nodes with sparse interactions, posing challenges for efficient fine-tuning. To address these issues, we introduce GraphSASA, a novel method for efficient fine-tuning in dynamic recommendation systems. GraphSASA employs test-time augmentation by leveraging the similarity of node representation distributions during hierarchical graph aggregation, which enhances node representations. Then it applies singular value decomposition, freezing the original vector matrix while focusing fine-tuning on the derived singular value matrices, which reduces the parameter burden of fine-tuning and improves the fine-tuning adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets."}

To address these issues, we proposed a principled method to estimate the temperature coefficient $β$ via quantile regression under mild assumptions. To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning.

They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This \"cognitive shortcutting\" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score. Analytical results also demonstrate its great potential to advance research in reasoningoriented information extraction. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HuiResearch/ReasoningIE."}

While recent approaches incorporate active learning and hierarchical contrastive loss to handle this drift, they remain fully supervised, computationally expensive, and perform poorly on real-world datasets with long temporal spans. In particular, our evaluation highlights these limitations, particularly on LAMDA, a 12-year longitudinal dataset exhibiting substantial distributional shifts. Moreover, manual expert labeling cannot scale with the daily emergence of over 450,000 new malware samples, leaving most samples unlabeled and underutilized.\n  To address these challenges, we propose CITADEL, a robust semi-supervised active learning framework for Android malware detection. To bridge the gap between image-domain semi-supervised learning and binary feature representations of malware, we introduce malware-specific augmentations, Bernoulli bit flips and masking, that simulate realistic drift behaviors. CITADEL further integrates supervised contrastive loss to improve boundary sample discrimination and combines it with a multi-criteria active learning strategy based on prediction confidence, $L_p$-norm distance, and boundary uncertainty, enabling effective adaptation under limited labeling budgets. Extensive evaluation on four large-scale Android malware benchmarks -- APIGraph, Chen-AZ, MaMaDroid, and LAMDA demonstrates that CITADEL outperforms prior work, achieving F1 score of over 1%, 3%, 7%, and 14% respectively, using only 40% labeled samples.

Existing computational pathology approaches instead tend to evaluate coarse diseased classification under full supervision with image-only models, so it remains unclear how vision-language models (VLMs) should be adapted for clinically meaningful subtyping under data constraints. In this work, we model fine-grained glomerular subtyping as a clinically realistic few-shot problem and systematically evaluate both pathology-specialized and general-purpose vision-language models under this setting. We assess not only classification performance (accuracy, AUC, F1) but also the geometry of the learned representations, examining feature alignment between image and text embeddings and the separability of glomerular subtypes. By jointly analyzing shot count, model architecture and domain knowledge, and adaptation strategy, this study provides guidance for future model selection and training under real clinical data constraints. Our results indicate that pathology-specialized vision-language backbones, when paired with the vanilla fine-tuning, are the most effective starting point. Even with only 4-8 labeled examples per glomeruli subtype, these models begin to capture distinctions and show substantial gains in discrimination and calibration, though additional supervision continues to yield incremental improvements. We also find that the discrimination between positive and negative examples is as important as image-text alignment. Overall, our results show that supervision level and adaptation strategy jointly shape both diagnostic performance and multimodal structure, providing guidance for model selection, adaptation strategies, and annotation investment."}

To address these issues, this paper presents an IPPG method that breaks the constraint of facial close-ups, achieving synergistic optimization of identity fidelity and scene semantic creation. Specifically, we design a Dual-Line Inference (DLI) pipeline with identity-semantic separation, resolving the representation conflict between ID and semantics inherent in traditional single-path architectures. Further, we propose an Identity Adaptive Fusion (IdAF) strategy that defers ID-semantic fusion to the noise prediction stage, integrating adaptive attention fusion and noise decision masking to avoid ID embedding interference on semantics without manual masking. Finally, an Identity Aggregation Prepending (IdAP) module is introduced to aggregate ID information and replace random initializations, further enhancing identity preservation. Experimental results validate that our method achieves stable and effective performance in IPPG tasks beyond facial close-ups, enabling efficient generation without manual masking or fine-tuning. As a plug-and-play component, it can be rapidly deployed in existing IPPG frameworks, addressing the over-reliance on facial close-ups, facilitating film-level character-scene creation, and providing richer personalized generation capabilities for related domains."}

Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods."}

A central contribution of ReCast is a reliability-aware codebook update strategy, which incrementally refines the codebook via weighted corrections. These correction weights are derived by fusing multiple reliability factors from complementary perspectives by a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme, ensuring adaptability to non-stationarity and robustness to distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCast outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to distribution shifts."}

This goal-aware communication strategy allows agents to share only relevant information, enhancing collaboration while respecting visibility limitations.

Among them, transformation-based attacks have demonstrated notable success in transfer attacks. However, existing attacks suffer from blind spots in parameter optimization, limiting their full potential. Specifically, (1) prior work generally considers low-iteration settings, yet attacks perform quite differently at higher iterations, so characterizing overall performance based only on low-iteration results is misleading. (2) Existing attacks use uniform parameters for different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks, which greatly impairs transferability. (3) Traditional transformation parameter optimization relies on grid search. For n parameters with m steps each, the complexity is O(mn). Large computational overhead limits further optimization of parameters. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study with various transformations as baselines, revealing three dynamic patterns of transferability with respect to parameter strength. We further propose a novel Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to effectively explain these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) based on the rise-then-fall pattern, reducing the complexity to O(nlogm). Comprehensive experiments on existing transformation-based attacks across different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks demonstrate that our DPO can significantly improve transferability."}

The deep learning models adopted in these studies demand significant computational resources for training and inference acceleration. This introduces high costs and undermines the cost-reduction goal of predictive mutation testing. (2) Constrained applicability. Although modern mutation testing tools generate mutants both inside and outside methods, current fine-grained predictive mutation testing approaches handle only inside-method mutants. As a result, they cannot predict outside-method mutants, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. We propose WITNESS, a new fine-grained predictive mutation testing approach. WITNESS adopts a twofold design: (1) With collected features from both inside-method and outside-method mutants, WITNESS is suitable for all generated mutants. (2) Instead of using computationally expensive deep learning, WITNESS employs lightweight classical machine learning models for training and prediction. This makes it more cost-effective and enabling straightforward explanations of the decision-making processes behind the adopted models. Evaluations on Defects4J projects show that WITNESS consistently achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across different scenarios. Additionally, WITNESS significantly enhances the efficiency of kill matrix prediction. Post-hoc analysis reveals that features incorporating information from before and after the mutation are the most important among those used in WITNESS. Test case prioritization based on the predicted kill matrix shows that WITNESS delivers results much closer to those obtained by using the actual kill matrix, outperforming baseline approaches."}

In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5.

Evaluated on breast and prostate datasets, RECAP-PATH produced rationales aligned with expert assessment and delivered substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy over baselines. By uniting visual understanding with reasoning, RECAP-PATH provides clinically trustworthy AI and demonstrates a generalizable path toward evidence-linked interpretation."}

As of now, the academic community has rigorously verified the number of solutions only up to N <= 26. In 2016, the research team led by PreuBer solved the 27-Queens problem using FPGA hardware, which took approximately one year, though the result remains unverified independently. Recent studies on GPU parallel computing suggest that verifying the 27-Queens solution would still require about 17 months, indicating excessively high time and computational resource costs. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative parallel computing method on NVIDIA GPU platform, with the following core contributions: (1) An iterative depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem; (2) Complete mapping of the required stack structure to GPU shared memory; (3) Effective avoidance of bank conflicts through meticulously designed memory access patterns; (4) Various optimization techniques are employed to achieve optimal performance. Under the proposed optimization framework, we successfully verified the 27-Queens problem in just 28.4 days using eight RTX 5090 GPUs, thereby confirming the correctness of PreuBer's computational results. Moreover, we have reduced the projected solving time for the next open case-the 28-Queens problem-to approximately 11 months, making its resolution computationally feasible. Compared to the state-of-the-art GPU methods, our method achieves over 10x speedup on identical hardware configurations (8 A100), while delivering over 26x acceleration when utilizing 8 RTX 5090 GPUs, and brings fresh perspectives to this long-stagnant problem."}

We address data challenges -- such as missing demographic attributes, missing wage data, and noisy occupation labels -- through various data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. In particular, we develop a large language models (LLMs) based occupation classification method known as FewSOC that achieves accuracy significantly higher than the original occupation labels in the resume dataset. Analysis of 228,710 career trajectories reveals that intra-firm occupation change has been found to facilitate upward mobility most strongly, followed by inter-firm occupation change and inter-firm lateral move.

To address this gap, we introduce a set of benchmarks that, instead of directly probing abstract norms or isolated statements, present models with realistic situational contexts that require culturally grounded reasoning. In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance.

Four synchronized cameras provide continuous visual coverage, with each frame processed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier devices using YOLOv11 segmentation for vehicle detection.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Weakly-Supervised Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension task (WGREC), a more practical paradigm that handles expressions with variable numbers of referents. However, extending WREC to WGREC presents two fundamental challenges: supervisory signal ambiguity, where weak image-level supervision is insufficient for training a model to infer the correct number and identity of referents, and semantic representation collapse, where standard Euclidean similarity forces hierarchically-related concepts into non-discriminative clusters, blurring categorical boundaries. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel WGREC framework named Linguistic Instance-Split Hyperbolic-Euclidean (LIHE), which operates in two stages. The first stage, Referential Decoupling, predicts the number of target objects and decomposes the complex expression into simpler sub-expressions. The second stage, Referent Grounding, then localizes these sub-expressions using HEMix, our innovative hybrid similarity module that synergistically combines the precise alignment capabilities of Euclidean proximity with the hierarchical modeling strengths of hyperbolic geometry. This hybrid approach effectively prevents semantic collapse while preserving fine-grained distinctions between related concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate LIHE establishes the first effective weakly supervised WGREC baseline on gRefCOCO and Ref-ZOM, while HEMix achieves consistent improvements on standard REC benchmarks, improving IoU@0.5 by up to 2.5\\%.

We observe that methods which separate range-space enforcement from null-space diffusion-prior updates yield stable, realistic reconstructions. Building on this, we introduce Null-Space Diffusion Distillation (NSDD): a single-pass student that distills the null-space component of an iterative DDNM+ solver, conditioned on the lensless measurement and on a range-space anchor. NSDD preserves measurement consistency and achieves photorealistic results without paired supervision at a fraction of the runtime and memory. On Lensless-FFHQ and PhlatCam, NSDD is the second fastest, behind Wiener, and achieves near-teacher perceptual quality (second-best LPIPS, below DDNM+), outperforming DPS and classical convex baselines.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that jointly integrates visual and physical cues for hand-object pose estimation. This integration is achieved through two key ideas: 1) joint visual-physical cue learning: The model is trained to extract 2D visual cues and 3D physical cues, thereby enabling more comprehensive representation learning for hand-object interactions; 2) candidate pose aggregation: A novel refinement process that aggregates multiple diffusion-generated candidate poses by leveraging both visual and physical predictions, yielding a final estimate that is visually consistent and physically plausible.

KV cache update, often implemented as allocation, copying, and in-place strided update for each generated token, incurs significant overhead. As the sequence length increases, the allocation and copy overheads dominate the performance. Alternate approaches may allocate large KV tensors upfront to enable in-place updates, but these matrices (with zero-padded rows) cause redundant computations. In this work, we propose a new KV cache allocation mechanism called Balancing Memory and Compute (BMC). BMC allocates, once every r iterations, KV tensors with r redundant rows, allowing in-place update without copy overhead for those iterations, but at the expense of a small amount of redundant computation. Second, we make an interesting observation that the extra rows allocated in the KV tensors and the resulting redundant computation can be repurposed for Speculative Decoding (SD) that improves token generation efficiency. Last, BMC represents a spectrum of design points with different values of r. To identify the best-performing design point(s), we derive a simple analytical model for BMC. The proposed BMC method achieves an average throughput acceleration of up to 3.2x over baseline HuggingFace (without SD). Importantly when we apply BMC with SD, it results in an additional speedup of up to 1.39x, over and above the speedup offered by SD. Further, BMC achieves a throughput acceleration of up to 1.36x and 2.29x over state-of-the-art inference servers vLLM and DeepSpeed, respectively. Although the BMC technique is evaluated extensively across different classes of CPUs (desktop and server class), we also evaluate the scheme with GPUs and demonstrate that it works well for GPUs."}

Existing methods typically rely solely on the model itself to learn semantic dependencies among visual token sequences. However, directly learning such semantic dependencies from data is challenging because the individual tokens lack clear semantic meanings, and these sequences are usually long. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Knowledge-Augmented Masked Image Generation framework, named KA-MIG, which introduces explicit knowledge of token-level semantic dependencies (\\emph{i.e.}, extracted from the training data) as priors to learn richer representations for improving performance. In particular, we explore and identify three types of advantageous token knowledge graphs, including two positive and one negative graphs (\\emph{i.e.}, the co-occurrence graph, the semantic similarity graph, and the position-token incompatibility graph). Based on three prior knowledge graphs, we design a graph-aware encoder to learn token and position-aware representations. After that, a lightweight fusion mechanism is introduced to integrate these enriched representations into the existing MIG methods. Resorting to such prior knowledge, our method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture semantic dependencies, leading to improved generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves upon existing MIG for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet."}

Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and naïvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability. These results indicate that focusing RL on critical, high-uncertainty tokens enables more reliable and targeted policy improvement for structured RTL code generation."}

Observed modalities are aligned with a local anchor that deviates from the optimal one when all modalities are present, resulting in an inevitable shift. To address this, we propose CalMRL for multimodal representation learning to calibrate incomplete alignments caused by missing modalities. Specifically, CalMRL leverages the priors and the inherent connections among modalities to model the imputation for the missing ones at the representation level. To resolve the optimization dilemma, we employ a bi-step learning method with the closed-form solution of the posterior distribution of shared latents. We validate its mitigation of anchor shift and convergence with theoretical guidance. By equipping the calibrated alignment with the existing advanced method, we offer new flexibility to absorb data with missing modalities, which is originally unattainable. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the superiority of CalMRL. Our code, model checkpoints, and evaluation raw data will be publicly available."}

To address this, we propose \\textbf{SRSplat}, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs high-resolution 3D scenes from only a few LR views. Our main insight is to compensate for the deficiency of texture information by jointly leveraging external high-quality reference images and internal texture cues.

To further refine predicted Gaussian primitives, we introduce \\textit{Texture-Aware Density Control (TADC)}, which adaptively adjusts Gaussian density based on the internal texture richness of the LR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SRSplat outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU, and exhibits strong cross-dataset and cross-resolution generalization capabilities."}

In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element-local (+ neighborhood) graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes."}

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are a common technique to assess such risks, yet existing approaches underperform in RAG due to black-box constraints and the absence of strong membership signals. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored side channel in RAG systems: the generation budget, which controls the maximum number of tokens allowed in a generated response. Varying this budget reveals observable behavioral patterns between member and non-member queries, as members gain quality more rapidly with larger budgets. Building on this insight, we propose BudgetLeak, a novel membership inference attack that probes responses under different budgets and analyzes metric evolution via sequence modeling or clustering. Extensive experiments across four datasets, three LLM generators, and two retrievers demonstrate that BudgetLeak consistently outperforms existing baselines, while maintaining high efficiency and practical viability. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked data risk in RAG systems and highlight the need for new defenses."}

Despite recent advances, non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data poses an inevitable challenge that hinders the use of FL. In this work, we address the issue of non-IID histopathological images with feature distribution shifts from an intuitive perspective that has only received limited attention. Specifically, we address this issue from the perspective of data distribution by solely adjusting the data distributions of all clients. Building on the success of diffusion models in fitting data distributions and leveraging stain separation to extract the pivotal features that are closely related to the non-IID properties of histopathological images, we propose a Federated Stain Distribution Alignment (FedSDA) method. FedSDA aligns the stain distribution of each client with a target distribution in an FL framework to mitigate distribution shifts among clients. Furthermore, considering that training diffusion models on raw data in FL has been shown to be susceptible to privacy leakage risks, we circumvent this problem while still effectively achieving alignment. Extensive experimental results show that FedSDA is not only effective in improving baselines that focus on mitigating disparities across clients' model updates but also outperforms baselines that address the non-IID data issues from the perspective of data distribution. We show that FedSDA provides valuable and practical insights for the computational pathology community."}

Existing KD backdoor methods are typically complex and computationally intensive: they employ surrogate student models and simulated distillation to guarantee transferability, and they construct triggers in a way similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which being not stealthy in magnitude, inherently exhibit strong adversarial behavior. This work questions whether such complexity is necessary and constructs stealthy \"weak\" triggers -- imperceptible perturbations that have negligible adversarial effect. We propose BackWeak, a simple, surrogate-free attack paradigm. BackWeak shows that a powerful backdoor can be implanted by simply fine-tuning a benign teacher with a weak trigger using a very small learning rate. We demonstrate that this delicate fine-tuning is sufficient to embed a backdoor that reliably transfers to diverse student architectures during a victim's standard distillation process, yielding high attack success rates. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, model architectures, and KD methods show that BackWeak is efficient, simpler, and often more stealthy than previous elaborate approaches. This work calls on researchers studying KD backdoor attacks to pay particular attention to the trigger's stealthiness and its potential adversarial characteristics."}

The FG-PINNs consist of two subnetworks, including a high-frequency subnetwork for capturing high-frequency components and a low-frequency subnetwork for capturing low-frequency components. The key innovation in the high-frequency subnetworks is to embed prior knowledge for high-frequency components into the network structure.

Today, databases treat these simulators as external pre-processing steps. Analysts must manually run a simulation, export the results, and load them into a database before analysis can begin. This linear workflow is inefficient, incurs high latency, and hinders interactive exploration, especially when the analysis itself dictates the need for new or refined simulation data.\n  We envision a new database paradigm, entitled GenIE, that seamlessly integrates multiple simulators into databases to enable dynamic orchestration of simulation workflows. By making the database \"simulation-aware,\" GenIE can dynamically invoke simulators with appropriate parameters based on the user's query and analytical needs. This tight integration allows GenIE to avoid generating data irrelevant to the analysis, reuse previously generated data, and support iterative, incremental analysis where results are progressively refined at interactive speeds.\n  We present our vision for GenIE, designed as an extension to PostgreSQL, and demonstrate its potential benefits through comprehensive use cases: wildfire smoke dispersion analysis using WRF-SFIRE and HYSPLIT, and hurricane hazard assessment integrating wind, surge, and flood models. Our preliminary experiments show how GenIE can transform these slow, static analyses into interactive explorations by intelligently managing the trade-off between simulation accuracy and runtime across multiple integrated simulators. We conclude by highlighting the challenges and opportunities ahead in realizing the full vision of GenIE as a cornerstone for next-generation scientific data analysis."}

Recent work showed that a carefully chosen set of these descriptors encodes all of the geometric and topological information about a shape in R^d. In practice, epsilon nets are often used to find samples in one of two extremes. On one hand, making strong geometric assumptions about the shape allows us to choose epsilon small enough (corresponding to a high enough density sample) in order to guarantee a faithful representation, resulting in oversampling. On the other hand, if we choose a larger epsilon in order to allow faster computations, this leads to an incomplete description of the shape and a discretized transform that lacks theoretical guarantees. In this work, we investigate how many directions are really needed to represent geometric simplicial complexes, exploring both synthetic and real-world datasets. We provide constructive proofs that help establish size bounds and an experimental investigation giving insights into the consequences of over- and undersampling."}

To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%."}

Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines."}

Subsequently, MF-SpeechGenerator functions as a conductor, achieving precise, composable and fine-grained control over these factors through dynamic fusion and Hierarchical Style Adaptive Normalization (HSAN). Experiments demonstrate that in the highly challenging multi-factor compositional speech generation task, MF-Speech significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a lower word error rate (WER=4.67%), superior style control (SECS=0.5685, Corr=0.68), and the highest subjective evaluation scores(nMOS=3.96, sMOS_emotion=3.86, sMOS_style=3.78). Furthermore, the learned discrete factors exhibit strong transferability, demonstrating their significant potential as a general-purpose speech representation."}

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions."}

Art conveys emotion through the joint design of visual and auditory elements, yet most prior work is human-centered or single-modality, overlooking the emotion intentionally expressed by the artwork. Meanwhile, current Audio-Visual Language Models (AVLMs) typically require large-scale audio pretraining to endow Visual Language Models (VLMs) with hearing, which limits scalability. We present Vision Anchored Audio-Visual Emotion LLM (VAEmotionLLM), a two-stage framework that teaches a VLM to hear by seeing with limited audio pretraining and to understand emotion across modalities. In Stage 1, Vision-Guided Audio Alignment (VG-Align) distills the frozen visual pathway into a new audio pathway by aligning next-token distributions of the shared LLM on synchronized audio-video clips, enabling hearing without a large audio dataset. In Stage 2, a lightweight Cross-Modal Emotion Adapter (EmoAdapter), composed of the Emotion Enhancer and the Emotion Supervisor, injects emotion-sensitive residuals and applies emotion supervision to enhance cross-modal emotion understanding. We also construct ArtEmoBenchmark, an art-centric emotion benchmark that evaluates content and emotion understanding under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual inputs. VAEmotionLLM achieves state-of-the-art results on ArtEmoBenchmark, outperforming audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual baselines. Ablations show that the proposed components are complementary."}

Corresponding author: Wencheng Zhu (wenchengzhu@tju.edu.cn)", "summary": "Vector quantization has emerged as a powerful tool in large-scale multimodal models, unifying heterogeneous representations through discrete token encoding. However, its effectiveness hinges on robust codebook design. Current prototype-based approaches relying on trainable vectors or clustered centroids fall short in representativeness and interpretability, even as multimodal alignment demonstrates its promise in vision-language models. To address these limitations, we propose a simple multimodal prompting-driven quantization framework for point cloud analysis. Our methodology is built upon two core insights: 1) Text embeddings from pre-trained models inherently encode visual semantics through many-to-one contrastive alignment, naturally serving as robust prototype priors; and 2) Multimodal prompts enable adaptive refinement of these prototypes, effectively mitigating vision-language semantic gaps. The framework introduces a dual-constrained quantization space, enforced by compactness and separation regularization, which seamlessly integrates visual and prototype features, resulting in hybrid representations that jointly encode geometric and semantic information. Furthermore, we employ Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to achieve differentiable discretization while maintaining quantization sparsity. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets clearly demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed method."}

We identify the root cause as a structural misalignment: Transformers assume sequential compositionality, while CTR data demand combinatorial reasoning over high-cardinality semantic fields. Unstructured attention spreads capacity indiscriminately, amplifying noise under extreme sparsity and breaking scalable learning. To restore alignment, we introduce the Field-Aware Transformer (FAT), which embeds field-based interaction priors into attention through decomposed content alignment and cross-field modulation. This design ensures model complexity scales with the number of fields F, not the total vocabulary size n >> F, leading to tighter generalization and, critically, observed power-law scaling in AUC as model width increases. We present the first formal scaling law for CTR models, grounded in Rademacher complexity, that explains and predicts this behavior. On large-scale benchmarks, FAT improves AUC by up to +0.51% over state-of-the-art methods. Deployed online, it delivers +2.33% CTR and +0.66% RPM. Our work establishes that effective scaling in recommendation arises not from size, but from structured expressivity-architectural coherence with data semantics."}

Inspired by the word embedding paradigm in natural language processing, this paper proposes the Embedding CFR algorithm, a novel approach for solving strategies in IIEFGs within an embedding space. The algorithm pre-trains and embeds features of isolated information sets into an interconnected low-dimensional continuous space, where the resulting vectors more precisely capture both the distinctions and connections between information sets. Embedding CFR presents a strategy-solving process driven by regret accumulation and strategy updates within this embedding space, with accompanying theoretical analysis verifying its capacity to reduce cumulative regret. Experiments on poker show that with the same spatial overhead, Embedding CFR achieves significantly faster exploitability convergence compared to cluster-based abstraction algorithms, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm in poker AI that pre-trains information set abstractions through low-dimensional embedding for strategy solving."}

However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification.

It enables efficient adaptation to new tasks while mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. These methods typically attach one independent task-specific prompt to each layer of pre-trained models to locally modulate its features, ensuring that the layer's representation aligns with the requirements of the new task. However, although introducing learnable prompts independently at each layer provides high flexibility for adapting to new tasks, this overly flexible tuning could make certain layers susceptible to unnecessary updates. As all prompts till the current task are added together as a final prompt for all seen tasks, the model may easily overwrite feature representations essential to previous tasks, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical layer-grouped prompt tuning method for continual learning. It improves model stability in two ways: (i) Layers in the same group share roughly the same prompts, which are adjusted by position encoding. This helps preserve the intrinsic feature relationships and propagation pathways of the pre-trained model within each group. (ii) It utilizes a single task-specific root prompt to learn to generate sub-prompts for each layer group. In this way, all sub-prompts are conditioned on the same root prompt, enhancing their synergy and reducing independence. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods."}

To alleviate the high training cost of SNNs, we introduce \\textbf{PACE} (Phase-Aligned Condensation for Events), the first dataset distillation framework to SNNs and event-based vision. PACE distills a large training dataset into a compact synthetic one that enables fast SNN training, which is achieved by two core modules: \\textbf{ST-DSM} and \\textbf{PEQ-N}.

To extend these successes to generate coherent long videos, most video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent frames conditioned on previous ones. There are generally two primary paradigms: chunk-based extension and stream denoising. The former directly concatenates previous clean frames as conditioning, suffering from denoising latency and error accumulation. The latter maintains the denoising sequence with monotonically increasing noise levels. In each denoising iteration, one clean frame is produced while a new pure noise is simultaneously appended, enabling live-stream sampling. However, it struggles with fragile consistency and poor motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens (ada-BOV) for autoregressive VDMs. The BOV tokens are special learnable embeddings on VDMs. They adaptively absorb denoised preceding frames via an adaptive-layer-norm-like modulation. This design preserves the global consistency while allowing for flexible conditioning in dynamic scenarios. To ensure the quality of local dynamics essential in modulating BOV tokens, we further propose a refinement strategy for stream denoising. It decouples the sampling trajectory length from the attention window size constraint, leading to improved local guidance and overall imaging quality. We also propose a disturbance-augmented training noise schedule, which balances the convergence speed with model robustness for the stream denoising.

Attribution methods can accurately identify a model's critical regions. However, masking these areas to create counterfactuals often causes the model to misclassify the target, while humans can still easily recognize it. This divergence highlights that the model's learned dependencies may not be sufficiently causal. To address this issue, we propose Subset-Selected Counterfactual Augmentation (SS-CA), which integrates counterfactual explanations directly into the training process for targeted intervention. Building on the subset-selection-based LIMA attribution method, we develop Counterfactual LIMA to identify minimal spatial region sets whose removal can selectively alter model predictions. Leveraging these attributions, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that replaces the identified regions with natural background, and we train the model jointly on both augmented and original samples to mitigate incomplete causal learning. Extensive experiments across multiple ImageNet variants show that SS-CA improves generalization on in-distribution (ID) test data and achieves superior performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks such as ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S. Under perturbations including noise, models trained with SS-CA also exhibit enhanced generalization, demonstrating that our approach effectively uses interpretability insights to correct model deficiencies and improve both performance and robustness."}

However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling."}

We introduce the perception gap index, a graph-based measure that quantifies local-global opinion divergence, which can be viewed as a generalization of the majority illusion to continuous settings. Using techniques from spectral graph theory, we demonstrate that higher connectivity makes networks more resilient to perception distortion. Our analysis of stochastic block models, however, shows that pronounced community structure increases vulnerability. We also study the problem of minimizing the perception gap via link recommendation with a fixed budget. We prove that this problem does not admit a polynomial-time algorithm for any bounded approximation ratio, unless P = NP. However, we propose a collection of efficient heuristic methods that have been demonstrated to produce near-optimal solutions on real-world network data."}

Guessing decoding, which infers the noise or codeword candidate in order of decreasing (exact or approximate) likelihood, offers a universal framework applicable to short codes. In this paper, we present a unified treatment of two prominent recent families of guessing decoding: guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) and guessing codeword decoding (GCD). For each, we (i) present algorithmic implementations and ordering strategies; (ii) prove maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality under appropriate stopping criteria; (iii) derive saddle-point approximations for the average number of queries; and (iv) validate theoretical predictions with simulations. We further analyze the performance degradation due to limited search budgets relative to ML performance, compare key metrics (worst-case and average complexity, hardware considerations), and highlight how advances in one approach transfer naturally to the other. Our results clarify the operating regimes where GRAND and GCD demonstrate superior performance. This work provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for deploying universal guessing decoders in next-generation short-blocklength communications."}

However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models."}

Recent advances in diffusion-based generative recommenders have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of user preferences. These approaches explore a broader range of user interests by progressively perturbing the distribution of user-item interactions and recovering potential preferences from noise, enabling nuanced behavioral understanding. However, existing diffusion-based approaches predominantly operate in continuous space through encoded graph-based historical interactions, which may compromise potential information loss and suffer from computational inefficiency. As such, we propose CDRec, a novel Continuous-time Discrete-space Diffusion Recommendation framework, which models user behavior patterns through discrete diffusion on historical interactions over continuous time. The discrete diffusion algorithm operates via discrete element operations (e.g., masking) while incorporating domain knowledge through transition matrices, producing more meaningful diffusion trajectories. Furthermore, the continuous-time formulation enables flexible adaptive sampling. To better adapt discrete diffusion models to recommendations, CDRec introduces: (1) a novel popularity-aware noise schedule that generates semantically meaningful diffusion trajectories, and (2) an efficient training framework combining consistency parameterization for fast sampling and a contrastive learning objective guided by multi-hop collaborative signals for personalized recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate CDRec's superior performance in both recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency."}

Unlike existing methods that separate radar target detection and motion estimation, RadarMP jointly models both tasks in a unified architecture, enabling consistent radar point cloud generation and pointwise 3D scene flow prediction. Tailored to radar characteristics, we design specialized self-supervised loss functions guided by Doppler shifts and echo intensity, effectively supervising spatial and motion consistency without explicit annotations. Extensive experiments on the public dataset demonstrate that RadarMP achieves reliable motion perception across diverse weather and illumination conditions, outperforming radar-based decoupled motion perception pipelines and enhancing perception capabilities for full-scenario autonomous driving systems."}

However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance."}

To address these issues, we propose Object Attribute Description Promoter (OAD-Promoter), a novel approach for enhancing LLM-based VQA by mitigating language bias and improving domain-shift robustness. OAD-Promoter comprises three components: the Object-concentrated Example Generation (OEG) module, the Memory Knowledge Assistance (MKA) module, and the OAD Prompt. The OEG module generates global captions and object-concentrated samples, jointly enhancing visual information input to the LLM and mitigating bias through complementary global and regional visual cues.

However, existing work has primarily focused on text-only scenario and largely overlooked the role of multimodality. We introduce MAVIS, the first benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal source attribution systems that understand user intent behind visual questions, retrieve multimodal evidence, and generate long-form answers with citations. Our dataset comprises 157K visual QA instances, where each answer is annotated with fact-level citations referring to multimodal documents. We develop fine-grained automatic metrics along three dimensions of informativeness, groundedness, and fluency, and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgments. Our key findings are threefold: (1) LVLMs with multimodal RAG generate more informative and fluent answers than unimodal RAG, but they exhibit weaker groundedness for image documents than for text documents, a gap amplified in multimodal settings. (2) Given the same multimodal documents, there is a trade-off between informativeness and groundedness across different prompting methods. (3) Our proposed method highlights mitigating contextual bias in interpreting image documents as a crucial direction for future research.

Particularly, Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) has been employed to generate dynamic gait parameters for the serpenoid gait function, which is implemented on the joint angles of the snake robot, thus controlling the robot on a desired dynamic path. NEAT is a single neural-network based evolutionary algorithm that is known to work extremely well when the input layer is of significantly higher dimension and the output layer is of a smaller size. For the planar snake robot, the input layer consists of the joint angles, link positions, head link position as well as obstacle positions in the vicinity. However, the output layer consists of only the frequency and offset angle of the serpenoid gait that control the speed and heading of the robot, respectively. Obstacle data from a LiDAR and the robot data from various sensors, along with the location of the end goal and time, are employed to parametrize a reward function that is maximized over iterations by selective propagation of superior neural networks. The implementation and experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, especially for large environments with many obstacles. The proposed framework has been verified through a physics engine simulation study on PyBullet. The approach shows superior results to existing state-of-the-art methodologies and comparable results to the very recent CBRL approach with significantly lower computational overhead.

Despite growing interest in attacking such models, the effectiveness of existing techniques remains unclear due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present. We evaluate BackdoorVLA in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic settings, achieving an average targeted success rate of 58.4% and reaching 100% on selected tasks. Our work provides a standardized framework for evaluating VLA vulnerabilities and demonstrates the potential for precise adversarial manipulation, motivating further research on securing VLA-based embodied systems."}

TSM exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time steps to produce a smooth curriculum within each sequence, which reduces gradient variance and stabilizes optimization with theoretical analysis. To employ auxiliary supervision from TSM, TMKT introduces two lightweight modality-aware objectives, Modality Aware Guidance (MAG) for per-frame source supervision and Mixup Ratio Perception (MRP) for sequence-level mix ratio estimation, which explicitly align temporal features with the mixing schedule.

In this paper, we present FIA-Edit, a novel inversion-free framework that achieves high-fidelity and semantically precise edits through a Frequency-Interactive Attention. Specifically, we design two key components: (1) a Frequency Representation Interaction (FRI) module that enhances cross-domain alignment by exchanging frequency components between source and target features within self-attention, and (2) a Feature Injection (FIJ) module that explicitly incorporates source-side queries, keys, values, and text embeddings into the target branch's cross-attention to preserve structure and semantics.

Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering.

This approach formulates multi-agent coordination as a dynamic potential game, where the Nash equilibrium (NE) defines optimal control strategies across agents.

In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program.

We empirically show that this paradigm often results in structural inconsistencies and topological artifacts due to limited geometric and semantic constraints. To address this, we rethink the task and propose a more robust paradigm, termed Completion-by-Correction, which begins with a topologically complete shape prior generated by a pretrained image-to-3D model and performs feature-space correction to align it with the partial observation. This paradigm shifts completion from unconstrained synthesis to guided refinement, enabling structurally consistent and observation-aligned reconstruction. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce PGNet, a multi-stage framework that conducts dual-feature encoding to ground the generative prior, synthesizes a coarse yet structurally aligned scaffold, and progressively refines geometric details via hierarchical correction.

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design theory that integrates grasping workspace similarity, walking workspace similarity, braced force for sit-to-stand (STS) movements, and overall mass and inertia. A geometric vector quantification method is developed using an ellipsoid to represent the workspace, aiming to reduce computational complexity and address quantification challenges. The ellipsoid envelope transforms workspace points into ellipsoid attributes, providing a parametric description of the workspace. Furthermore, the STS static braced force assesses the effectiveness of force transmission. The overall mass and inertia restricts excessive link length. To facilitate rapid and stable convergence of the model to high-dimensional irregular Pareto fronts, we introduce a multi-subpopulation correction firefly algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a strategy involving attractive and repulsive domains to effectively handle the MOO task. The optimized solution is utilized to redesign the prototype for experimentation to meet specified requirements. Six healthy participants and two hemiplegia patients participated in real experiments. Compared to the pre-optimization results, the average grasp success rate improved by 7.2%, while the muscle activity during walking and STS tasks decreased by an average of 12.7% and 25.1%, respectively. The proposed design theory offers an efficient option for the design of multi-functional SRL mechanisms."}

Accepted by AAAI2026", "summary": "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in training large-scale models. As the model size continues to scale, concerns are growing about the depletion of high-quality, well-curated training data. This has led practitioners to explore training approaches like Federated Learning (FL), which can leverage the abundant data on edge devices while maintaining privacy. However, the decentralization of training datasets in FL introduces challenges to scaling large models, a topic that remains under-explored. This paper fills this gap and provides qualitative insights on generalizing the previous model scaling experience to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, we derive a PAC-Bayes (Probably Approximately Correct Bayesian) upper bound for the generalization error of models trained with stochastic algorithms in federated settings and quantify the impact of distributed training data on the optimal model size by finding the analytic solution of model size that minimizes this bound. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the optimal model size has a negative power law relationship with the number of clients if the total training compute is unchanged. Besides, we also find that switching to FL with the same training compute will inevitably reduce the upper bound of generalization performance that the model can achieve through training, and that estimating the optimal model size in federated scenarios should depend on the average training compute across clients. Furthermore, we also empirically validate the correctness of our results with extensive training runs on different models, network settings, and datasets."}

One such example is imbalanced data classification, where, on the one hand, we want to achieve the best possible classification quality for data from the minority class without degrading the classification quality of the majority class. One solution is to propose an aggregate learning criterion and reduce the multi-objective learning task to a single-criteria optimization problem. Unfortunately, such an approach is characterized by ambiguity of interpretation since the value of the aggregated criterion does not indicate the value of the component criteria. Hence, there are more and more proposals for algorithms based on multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can simultaneously optimize multiple criteria. However, such an approach results in a set of multiple non-dominated solutions (Pareto front). The selection of a single solution from the Pareto front is a challenge itself, and much attention is paid to the issue of how to select it considering user preferences, as well as how to compare solutions returned by different MOO algorithms among themselves. Thus, a significant gap has been identified in the classifier evaluation methodology, i.e., how to reliably compare methods returning single solutions with algorithms returning solutions in the form of Pareto fronts.\n  To fill the aforementioned gap, this article proposes a new, reliable way of evaluating algorithms based on multi-objective algorithms with methods that return single solutions while pointing out solutions from a Pareto front tailored to the user's preferences. This work focuses only on algorithm comparison, not their learning. The algorithms selected for this study are illustrative to help understand the proposed approach."}

While deep learning-based driver activity recognition methods have shown promise in detecting such distractions, their effectiveness in real-world deployments is hindered by two critical challenges: variations in camera viewpoints (cross-view) and domain shifts such as change in sensor modality or environment. Existing methods typically address either cross-view generalization or unsupervised domain adaptation in isolation, leaving a gap in the robust and scalable deployment of models across diverse vehicle configurations. In this work, we propose a novel two-phase cross-view, cross-modal unsupervised domain adaptation framework that addresses these challenges jointly on real-time driver monitoring data. In the first phase, we learn view-invariant and action-discriminative features within a single modality using contrastive learning on multi-view data. In the second phase, we perform domain adaptation to a new modality using information bottleneck loss without requiring any labeled data from the new domain. We evaluate our approach using state-of-the art video transformers (Video Swin, MViT) and multi modal driver activity dataset called Drive&Act, demonstrating that our joint framework improves top-1 accuracy on RGB video data by almost 50% compared to a supervised contrastive learning-based cross-view method, and outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation-only methods by up to 5%, using the same video transformer backbone."}

Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and its implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potential lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG function variants, and spike encoding schemes."}

Therefore, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Learning (HSL) framework to tackle this problem. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Style Randomization (DSR) module and a Hierarchical Semantic Mining (HSM) module to learn hierarchical semantic features, thereby enhancing the model's ability to recognize semantics at varying granularities. DSR simulates target domain data with diverse foreground-background style differences and overall style variations through foreground and global style randomization respectively, while HSM leverages multi-scale superpixels to guide the model to mine intra-class consistency and inter-class distinction at different granularities. Additionally, we also propose a Prototype Confidence-modulated Thresholding (PCMT) module to mitigate segmentation ambiguity when foreground and background are excessively similar. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular target domain datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

In this paper, we introduce OmniSparse, a training-aware fine-grained sparse attention framework for long-video MLLMs, which operates in both training and inference with dynamic token budget allocation. Specifically, OmniSparse contains three adaptive and complementary mechanisms: (1) query selection via lazy-active classification, retaining active queries that capture broad semantic similarity while discarding most lazy ones that focus on limited local context and exhibit high functional redundancy; (2) KV selection with head-level dynamic budget allocation, where a shared budget is determined based on the flattest head and applied uniformly across all heads to ensure attention recall; and (3) KV cache slimming to reduce head-level redundancy by selectively fetching visual KV cache according to the head-level decoding query pattern. Experimental results show that OmniSparse matches the performance of full attention while achieving up to 2.7x speedup during prefill and 2.4x memory reduction during decoding."}

However, these methods often suffer from shape and texture misalignment across generated multi-view images, leading to low-quality 3D generation results, such as incomplete geometric details and textural ghosting. Some methods are mainly optimized for the frontal perspective and exhibit poor robustness to oblique perspective inputs. In this paper, to tackle the above challenges, we propose a high-quality image-to-3D approach, named LSS3D, with learnable spatial shifting to explicitly and effectively handle the multiview inconsistencies and non-frontal input view. Specifically, we assign learnable spatial shifting parameters to each view, and adjust each view towards a spatially consistent target, guided by the reconstructed mesh, resulting in high-quality 3D generation with more complete geometric details and clean textures. Besides, we include the input view as an extra constraint for the optimization, further enhancing robustness to non-frontal input angles, especially for elevated viewpoint inputs. We also provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation pipeline that can contribute to the community in performance comparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves leading results in both geometric and texture evaluation metrics across more flexible input viewpoints."}

Most existing methods, which rely on extending single images, face notable computational challenges in maintaining cross-view consistency and generating high-resolution outputs. To address these issues, we propose the Geometry-guided Multi-View Diffusion Model, which incorporates mechanisms for extracting multi-view geometric information and adjusting the intensity of geometric features to generate images that are both consistent across views and rich in detail. Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation. Finally, a dynamic geometry information intensity adjustment mechanism is proposed to adaptively regulate the influence of geometric data, optimizing overall quality while ensuring the naturalness of generated images.

This router sparsely selects the top-$k$ hidden states and is trained with an $ε$-greedy strategy, efficiently selecting contextual features with minimal learnable parameters and negligible computational overhead.

A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark.

We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns.

SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes through eigendecomposition of the covariance of the differences between features collected for truthful and hallucinatory captions, revealing structured biases in the feature space. A soft spectral filter then attenuates these modes in the feed-forward projection weights of deeper vLLM layers, equalizing feature variance while preserving semantic fidelity. Unlike decoding or retraining-based approaches, SRF operates entirely post-hoc, incurs zero inference overhead, and requires no architectural modifications.

Rule-based detection often identifies malicious logs based on the predefined grammar logic, requiring experts with deep domain knowledge for rule generation. Therefore, automation of rule generation can result in significant time savings and ease the burden of rule-related tasks on security engineers. In this paper, we propose RulePilot, which mimics human expertise via LLM-based agent for addressing rule-related challenges like rule creation or conversion. Using RulePilot, the security analysts do not need to write down the rules following the grammar, instead, they can just provide the annotations such as the natural-language-based descriptions of a rule, our RulePilot can automatically generate the detection rules without more intervention. RulePilot is equipped with the intermediate representation (IR), which abstracts the complexity of config rules into structured, standardized formats, allowing LLMs to focus on generation rules in a more manageable and consistent way. We present a comprehensive evaluation of RulePilot in terms of textual similarity and execution success abilities, showcasing RulePilot can generate high-fidelity rules, outperforming the baseline models by up to 107.4% in textual similarity to ground truths and achieving better detection accuracy in real-world execution tests. We perform a case study from our industry collaborators in Singapore, showcasing that RulePilot significantly help junior analysts/general users in the rule creation process."}

The core eFPE algorithm module itself is notably compact, requiring only 3.55 kB ROM and 116 B RAM.

However, the widespread adoption of static analysis tools is hindered by their high false alarm rates. Previous studies have introduced the concept of actionable warnings and built a machine-learning method to distinguish actionable warnings from false alarms. However, according to our empirical observation, the current assumption used for actionable warning(s) collection is rather shaky and inaccurate, leading to a large number of invalid actionable warnings. To address this problem, in this study, we build the first large actionable warning dataset by mining 68,274 reversions from Top-500 GitHub C repositories, we then take one step further by assigning each actionable warning a weak label regarding its likelihood of being a real bug. Following that, we propose a two-stage framework called ACWRecommender to automatically recommend the actionable warnings with high probability to be real bugs (AWHB). Our approach warms up the pre-trained model UniXcoder by identifying actionable warnings task (coarse-grained detection stage) and rerank AWHB to the top by weakly supervised learning (fine-grained reranking stage). Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several baselines by a large margin in terms of nDCG and MRR for AWHB recommendation. Moreover, we ran our tool on 6 randomly selected projects and manually checked the top-ranked warnings from 2,197 reported warnings, we reported top-10 recommended warnings to developers, 27 of them were already confirmed by developers as real bugs. Developers can quickly find real bugs among the massive amount of reported warnings, which verifies the practical usage of our tool."}

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods require over 2000+ hours of extensive training and often struggle to generalize to unfamiliar environments without additional fine-tuning, limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SocialNav-Map, a novel zero-shot social navigation framework that combines dynamic human trajectory prediction with occupancy mapping, enabling safe and efficient navigation without the need for environment-specific training. Specifically, SocialNav-Map first transforms the task goal position into the constructed map coordinate system. Subsequently, it creates a dynamic occupancy map that incorporates predicted human movements as dynamic obstacles. The framework employs two complementary methods for human trajectory prediction: history prediction and orientation prediction. By integrating these predicted trajectories into the occupancy map, the robot can proactively avoid potential collisions with humans while efficiently navigating to its destination. Extensive experiments on the Social-HM3D and Social-MP3D datasets demonstrate that SocialNav-Map significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL-based methods, which require 2,396 GPU hours of training. Notably, it reduces human collision rates by over 10% without necessitating any training in novel environments. By eliminating the need for environment-specific training, SocialNav-Map achieves superior navigation performance, paving the way for the deployment of social navigation systems in real-world environments characterized by diverse human behaviors.

The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems."}

Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

While some works focus on opportunistic approaches for efficiency, others concentrate on pre-planned trajectories or scheduling for increased interpretability.

In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently. We provide an open-source implementation of both the MILP plan generator and the large-scale MRE-CCIC."}

In this paper, we use case studies from the philosophy of science literature to critically examine whether the world model framework adequately characterizes human-level understanding. We focus on specific philosophical analyses where the distinction between world model capabilities and human understanding is most pronounced.

Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition.

We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks.

Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts.

Building on LRS-GRO, we propose ZoomEarth, an adaptive cropping-zooming framework with a novel Region-Guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), ZoomEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance on LRS-GRO and, in the zero-shot setting, on three public UHR remote sensing benchmarks. Furthermore, ZoomEarth can be seamlessly integrated with downstream models for tasks such as cloud removal, denoising, segmentation, and image editing through simple tool interfaces, demonstrating strong versatility and extensibility."}

Although transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable results, their high computational cost hinders clinical deployment. To address this issue, we propose TM-UNet, a novel lightweight framework that integrates token sequence modeling with an efficient memory mechanism for efficient medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale token-memory (MSTM) block that transforms 2D spatial features into token sequences through strategic spatial scanning, leveraging matrix memory cells to selectively retain and propagate discriminative contextual information across tokens. This novel token-memory mechanism acts as a dynamic knowledge store that captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient global reasoning without redundant computation. Our MSTM block further incorporates exponential gating to identify token effectiveness and multi-scale contextual extraction via parallel pooling operations, enabling hierarchical representation learning without computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TM-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse medical segmentation tasks with substantially reduced computation cost.

We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language models become more integrated into human decision-making processes."}

A key innovation is the incorporation of adaptive resampling to close the loop of particle and density field description of solutions, mimicking mutation in genetics.

Moreover, the digitalised services provided by governmental organisations and companies are governed by an increasing amount of laws and regulations, requiring highly adaptable compliance practices. A potential solution is to automate compliance using software. However, automating compliance is difficult for various reasons. Legal practices involve subjective processes such as interpretation and qualification. New laws and regulations come into effect regularly and laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, are subjected to constant revision. In addition, computational reasoning with laws requires a cross-disciplinary process involving both legal and software expertise.\n  This paper reflects on the domain-specific software language eFLINT developed to experiment with novel solutions. The language combines declarative and procedural elements to reason about situations and scenarios respectively, explicates and formalises connections between legal concepts and computational concepts, and is designed to automate compliance checks both before, during and after a software system runs. The various goals and applications areas for the language give rise to (conflicting) requirements. This paper reflects on the current design of the language by recalling various applications, the requirements they imposed, and subsequent design decisions.

Such adaptation requires code conversion, wherein data encoded under an initial $[k^I + r^I, k^I]$ code is transformed into data encoded under a final $[k^F + r^F, k^F]$ code - an operation that can be resource-intensive. Convertible codes are a class of codes designed to facilitate this transformation efficiently while preserving desirable properties such as the MDS property. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits on the bandwidth cost of conversion (total amount of data transferred between the storage nodes during conversion) for systematic MDS convertible codes. Specifically, we study the subclass of conversions known as the split regime (a single initial codeword is converted into multiple final codewords).\n  In this setting, prior to this work, the best known lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of conversion for all parameters were derived by Maturana and Rashmi under certain uniformity assumptions on the number of symbols downloaded from each node. Further, these bounds were shown to be tight for the parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq r^F$. In this work, we derive lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of systematic MDS convertible codes for all parameters in the split regime without the uniformity assumption. Moreover, our bounds are tight for the broader parameter regime where $r^F \\geq k^F$ or $r^I \\leq k^F$. Subsequently, our bounds also partially resolve the conjecture proposed by Maturana and Rashmi. We employ a novel information-theoretic framework, which assumes only that the initial and final codes are systematic and does not rely on any linearity assumptions or the aforementioned uniformity assumptions."}

However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance. The code is released at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM."}

Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs.

Sample consensus techniques - such as majority voting or validation against generated tests or specifications - aim to identify a correct program in the sample or abstain if none is valid. However, existing methods often fail to select a correct solution when its sampling probability is low, or when the problem permits multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions. Additionally, they often fail to abstain when no correct solution is present in the sample. To overcome these limitations, we introduce semantic triangulation, which transforms a programming problem in a way that non-trivially alters its semantics while preserving an exact, verifiable mapping between solutions before and after transformation. We theoretically establish that verifying consistency across such problem transformations increases confidence that generated programs reflect accurate generalization rather than spurious statistical correlations, enabling more reliable sample consensus and abstention. On the LiveCodeBench and CodeElo benchmarks, using GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 models, semantic triangulation increases reliability of generated code by 21% compared to the method that selects only high-confidence solutions with the probability threshold 0.5, while being able to pinpoint correct solutions at sampling probabilities as low as 0.14. Apart from that, it is also the only approach to consistently form true consensus on tasks with multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions."}

The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community. To ensure the quality of the augmented extractive summaries, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation with the original abstractive gold standard summaries covering structural, lexical, and semantic dimensions.

The main result is an explicit choice of smoothing parameters that makes all modes respond in the same way, causing the nontrivial eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator to collapse to a single value. This gives a clear and self-contained description of the ideal version of the method and provides a concrete target for designing related schemes. Although the exact spectral collapse requires ideal components, we also show that the same construction naturally produces operators that resemble those used in practical discretizations.

This paper identifies the frequency misalignment between real and synthesized images as one of the key factors underlying unreliable GDA and proposes the Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method to reduce the frequency distributional discrepancy and thus improve GDA. FreRec involves (1) Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) to roughly align high-frequency components and (2) Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) to enhance image quality and reconstruct high-frequency details. Extensive experiments were conducted in various medical datasets, including brain MRIs, chest X-rays, and fundus images.

Our result makes the $L^*$ algorithm applicable to new settings like (real) RGX, and time series. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it asks a number of queries to the teacher that is at most linear with respect to the number of transitions, and to the representation size of the predicates."}

This is further enriched with accompanying pedagogical changes, such as strengthened asynchronous learning, and the use of AI (from ChatGPT and all other similar tools that followed) and other technologies to aid learning. While these educational transformations have enabled flexibility in learning and resource access, they have also exposed new challenges on how students can construct successful learning in hybrid learning environments. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between different dimensions of student learning experiences (ranging from perceived acceptance of teaching methods and staff support/feedback to learning pressure and student motivation) and academic achievement within the context of postgraduate blended learning in UK universities. To achieve this, we employed a combination of several data analytics techniques including visualization, statistical tests, regression analysis, and latent profile analysis. Our empirical results (based on a survey of 255 postgraduate students and holistically interpreted via the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework) demonstrated that learning activities combining teaching and social presences, and tailored academic support through effective feedback are critical elements for successful postgraduate experience in blended learning contexts. Regarding contributions, this research advances the understanding of student success by identifying the various ways demographic, experiential, and psychological factors impact academic outcomes. And in theoretical terms, it contributes to the extension of the CoI framework by integrating the concept of learner heterogeneity and identifying four distinct student profiles based on how they engage in the different CoI presences."}

Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features."}

In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $β$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling.

We show that the embedding space of VLMs, such as CLIP, can be divided into semantically consistent subspaces. Based on this property, we propose a training-free framework that models negation as a subspace in the joint embedding space rather than a single point (Figure 1). To find the matching image for a caption such as \"A but not N,\" we construct two spherical caps around the embeddings of A and N, and we score images by the central direction of the region that is close to A and far from N.

We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates.

We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA).

As a result, high-end processors typically feature lower memory bandwidth per core, at the detriment of memory-intensive workloads. We propose alleviating this challenge by improving the utility of the CPU's limited pins. In a typical CPU design process, the available pins are apportioned between memory and I/O traffic, each accounting for about half of the total off-chip bandwidth availability. Consequently, unless both memory and I/O are simultaneously highly utilized, such fragmentation leads to underutilization of the valuable off-chip bandwidth resources. An ideal architecture would offer I/O and memory bandwidth fungibility, allowing use of the aggregate off-chip bandwidth in the form required by each workload.\n  In this work, we introduce SURGE, a software-supported architectural technique that boosts memory bandwidth availability by salvaging idle I/O bandwidth resources. SURGE leverages the capability of versatile interconnect technologies like CXL to dynamically multiplex memory and I/O traffic over the same processor interface. We demonstrate that SURGE-enhanced architectures can accelerate memory-intensive workloads on bandwidth-constrained servers by up to 1.3x."}

The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR.

In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations."}

Further, to evaluate the quality of generated explanations, a common approach is to adopt an \"MLLM as a judge\" methodology to evaluate explanations generated by other MLLMs. However, how well those MLLMs perform when judging explanations for AI-generated image detection generated by themselves or other MLLMs has not been well studied.

However, existing methods for reasoning segmentation require multimodal large language models with billions of parameters that exceed the computational capabilities of edge devices that typically deploy the embodied AI systems. Distillation offers a pathway to compress these models while preserving their capabilities. Yet, existing distillation approaches fail to transfer the multi-step reasoning capabilities that reasoning segmentation demands, as they focus on matching output predictions and intermediate features rather than preserving reasoning chains. The emerging paradigm of reasoning over digital twin representations presents an opportunity for more effective distillation by re-framing the problem. Consequently, we propose FastReasonSeg, which employs digital twin representations that decouple perception from reasoning to enable more effective distillation. Our distillation scheme first relies on supervised fine-tuning on teacher-generated reasoning chains. Then it is followed by reinforcement fine-tuning with joint rewards evaluating both segmentation accuracy and reasoning quality alignment. Experiments on two video (JiTBench, RVTBench) and two image benchmarks (ReasonSeg, LLM-Seg40K) demonstrate that our FastReasonSeg achieves state-of-the-art reasoning segmentation performance.

Instead of relying on vision-language models directly, we propose representing video content as digital twins, i.e., structured scene representations that decompose salient objects through specialist vision models. This approach is beneficial because it enables large language models to reason directly over long-horizon video content without visual token compression. Specifically, our two-stage framework first performs compositional alignment between decomposed sub-queries and digital twin representations for candidate identification, then applies large language model-based reasoning with just-in-time refinement that invokes additional specialist models to address information gaps.

While these mHealth chatbots offer clear benefits, such as personalized health information and predictive diagnoses, they also raise significant concerns regarding security and privacy. This study empirically assesses 16 AI-based mHealth chatbots identified from the Google Play Store. The empirical assessment follows a three-phase approach (manual inspection, static code analysis, and dynamic analysis) to evaluate technical robustness and how design and implementation choices impact end users. Our findings revealed security vulnerabilities (e.g., enabling Remote WebView debugging), privacy issues, and non-compliance with Google Play policies (e.g., failure to provide publicly accessible privacy policies). Based on our findings, we offer several recommendations to enhance the security and privacy of mHealth chatbots. These recommendations focus on improving data handling processes, disclosure, and user security. Therefore, this work also seeks to support mHealth developers and security/privacy engineers in designing more transparent, privacy-friendly, and secure mHealth chatbots."}

First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust performance across varying suggester qualities, adaptation to changing reliability, and strategic management of suggestion requests. This work provides a foundation for adaptive human-agent collaboration by addressing suggestion uncertainty in uncertain environments."}

We implement and analyze MAML-TRPO's ability to learn a universal initialization that facilitates few-shot adaptation across semantically different manipulation behaviors including pushing, picking, and drawer manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that MAML achieves effective one-shot adaptation with clear performance improvements after a single gradient update, reaching final success rates of 21.0% on training tasks and 13.2% on held-out test tasks.

IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.\n  While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.\n  To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858. Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities."}

We pre-process the kidney images using denoising and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance feature extraction.

To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers. Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage.

Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding. Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases.

However, they often struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution due to decision boundaries that lack a clear definition of normality. Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability."}

However, traditional teleoperation systems rely on inverse kinematics (IK) solvers and hand-tuned PD controllers, which struggle to handle external forces, adapt to different users, and produce natural motions under dynamic conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based neural teleoperation framework that replaces the conventional IK+PD pipeline with learned policies trained via reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to directly map VR controller inputs to robot joint commands while implicitly handling force disturbances, producing smooth trajectories, and adapting to user preferences. We train our policies in simulation using demonstrations collected from IK-based teleoperation as initialization, then fine-tune them with force randomization and trajectory smoothness rewards. Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that our learned policies achieve 34% lower tracking error, 45% smoother motions, and superior force adaptation compared to the IK baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (50Hz control frequency). We validate our approach on manipulation tasks including object pick-and-place, door opening, and bimanual coordination. These results suggest that learning-based approaches can significantly improve the naturalness and robustness of humanoid teleoperation systems."}

Next, we measure the Power Spectral Density (PSD) for all five EEG frequency bands and generate the channel power values as 2D images referred to as multi-spectral topography maps. These multi-spectral topography maps are then fed to a separate encoder to obtain the representations in frequency domain. Our solution employs a multi-domain attention module that maps these domain-specific embeddings onto a shared embedding space to emphasize more on important inter-domain relationships to enhance the representations for cognitive load classification. Additionally, we incorporate an orthogonal projection constraint during the training of our method to effectively increase the inter-class distances while improving intra-class clustering. This enhancement allows efficient discrimination between different cognitive states and aids in better grouping of similar states within the feature space. We validate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on two public EEG datasets, CL-Drive and CLARE for cognitive load classification. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-domain approach over the traditional single-domain techniques. Moreover, we conduct ablation and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of various components of our method.

We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response \"Sure\" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the \"Sure\" rate approaches 100\\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors."}

The experiment results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness performance over the current state-of-the-art rotation estimation methods, even comparable to multiple bundle adjustment iteration results. Hopefully, this work contributes to even more accurate, efficient and reliable 3D visual computing."}

To bridge this gap, we propose TSODE, a safety-aware controller that integrates Thompson Sampling RL with a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NeuralODE) forecaster to address this challenge. Specifically, the NeuralODE predicts short-term glucose trajectories conditioned on proposed insulin doses, while a conformal calibration layer quantifies predictive uncertainty to reject or scale risky actions. In the FDA-approved UVa/Padova simulator (adult cohort), TSODE achieved 87.9% time-in-range with less than 10% time below 70 mg/dL, outperforming relevant baselines. These results demonstrate that integrating adaptive RL with calibrated NeuralODE forecasting enables interpretable, safe, and robust glucose regulation."}

However, real-world images are often degraded by adverse weather, and weather restoration methods may sacrifice high-frequency details critical for analyzing small objects. A natural solution is to apply super-resolution (SR) after weather removal to recover both clarity and fine structures. However, simply cascading restoration and SR struggle to bridge their inherent conflict: removal aims to remove high-frequency weather-induced noise, while SR aims to hallucinate high-frequency textures from existing details, leading to inconsistent restoration contents. In this paper, we take deraining as a case study and propose DHGM, a Diffusion-based High-frequency Guided Model for generating clean and high-resolution images. DHGM integrates pre-trained diffusion priors with high-pass filters to simultaneously remove rain artifacts and enhance structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHGM achieves superior performance over existing methods, with lower costs."}

ResNet can be viewed as a discretized form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). From this perspective, the multiple residual blocks within a single ResNet stage essentially perform multi-step discrete iterations of the feature transformation for that stage. The recently proposed flow matching model, MeanFlow, enables one-step generative modeling by learning the mean velocity field to transform distributions. Inspired by this, we propose MeanFlow-Incubated ResNet (MFI-ResNet), which employs a compression-expansion strategy to jointly improve parameter efficiency and discriminative performance. In the compression phase, we simplify the multi-layer structure within each ResNet stage to one or two MeanFlow modules to construct a lightweight meta model. In the expansion phase, we apply a selective incubation strategy to the first three stages, expanding them to match the residual block configuration of the baseline ResNet model, while keeping the last stage in MeanFlow form, and fine-tune the incubated model. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, MFI-ResNet achieves remarkable parameter efficiency, reducing parameters by 46.28% and 45.59% compared to ResNet-50, while still improving accuracy by 0.23% and 0.17%, respectively. This demonstrates that generative flow-fields can effectively characterize the feature transformation process in ResNet, providing a new perspective for understanding the relationship between generative modeling and discriminative learning."}

Recent work integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to jointly model semantics and structure, resulting in more general and expressive models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on TAG benchmarks. However, this integration introduces dual vulnerabilities: GNNs are sensitive to structural perturbations, while LLM-derived features are vulnerable to prompt injection and adversarial phrasing. While existing adversarial attacks largely perturb structure or text independently, we find that uni-modal attacks cause only modest degradation in LLM-enhanced GNNs. Moreover, many existing attacks assume unrealistic capabilities, such as white-box access or direct modification of graph data. To address these gaps, we propose GRAPHTEXTACK, the first black-box, multi-modal{, poisoning} node injection attack for LLM-enhanced GNNs. GRAPHTEXTACK injects nodes with carefully crafted structure and semantics to degrade model performance, operating under a realistic threat model without relying on model internals or surrogate models. To navigate the combinatorial, non-differentiable search space of connectivity and feature assignments, GRAPHTEXTACK introduces a novel evolutionary optimization framework with a multi-objective fitness function that balances local prediction disruption and global graph influence. Extensive experiments on five datasets and two state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced GNN models show that GRAPHTEXTACK significantly outperforms 12 strong baselines."}

Monitoring these digital campaigns is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability in democratic processes. Leveraging Meta's Ad Library, we analyze political advertising on Facebook and Instagram during the 2022 Australian federal election campaign. We investigate temporal, demographic, and geographical patterns in the advertising strategies of major Australian political actors to establish an empirical evidence base, and interpret these findings through the lens of Social Identity Theory (SIT). Our findings not only reveal significant disparities in spending and reach among parties, but also in persuasion strategies being deployed in targeted online campaigns. We observe a marked increase in advertising activity as the election approached, peaking just before the mandated media blackout period. Demographic analysis shows distinct targeting strategies, with parties focusing more on younger demographics and exhibiting gender-based differences in ad impressions. Regional distribution of ads largely mirrored population densities, with some parties employing more targeted approaches in specific states. Moreover, we found that parties emphasized different themes aligned with their ideologies-major parties focused on party names and opponents, while smaller parties emphasized issue-specific messages. Drawing on SIT, we interpret these findings within Australia's compulsory voting context, suggesting that parties employed distinct persuasion strategies. With turnout guaranteed, major parties focused on reinforcing partisan identities to prevent voter defection, while smaller parties cultivated issue-based identities to capture the support of disaffected voters who are obligated to participate."}

While visual token pruning has been extensively studied for autoregressive VLMs (AVLMs), it remains largely unexplored for DVLMs. In this work, we propose RedVTP, a response-driven visual token pruning strategy that leverages the inference dynamics of DVLMs. Our method estimates visual token importance using attention from the masked response tokens. Based on the observation that these importance scores remain consistent across steps, RedVTP prunes the less important visual tokens from the masked tokens after the first inference step, thereby maximizing inference efficiency. Experiments show that RedVTP improves token generation throughput of LLaDA-V and LaViDa by up to 186% and 28.05%, respectively, and reduces inference latency by up to 64.97% and 21.87%, without compromising-and in some cases improving-accuracy."}

In this work, we investigate these challenges through the lens of reasoning token coverage and argue that initializing LLMs with diverse, high-quality reasoning primitives is essential for achieving stable and sample-efficient RL training. We propose Tailor, a finetuning pipeline that automatically discovers and curates novel reasoning primitives, thereby expanding the coverage of reasoning-state distributions before RL.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified multi-modality image fusion framework based on channel perturbation and pre-trained knowledge integration (UP-Fusion). To suppress redundant modal information and emphasize key features, we propose the Semantic-Aware Channel Pruning Module (SCPM), which leverages the semantic perception capability of a pre-trained model to filter and enhance multi-modality feature channels.

However, scaling deeper GNNs poses challenges due to the neighbor explosion problem when training on large-scale graphs. To mitigate this, a promising class of GNN training algorithms utilizes historical embeddings to reduce computation and memory costs while preserving the expressiveness of the model. These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods. However, the staleness of these historical embeddings often introduces significant bias, acting as a bottleneck that can adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel VersatIle Staleness-Aware GNN, named VISAGNN, which dynamically and adaptively incorporates staleness criteria into the large-scale GNN training process. By embedding staleness into the message passing mechanism, loss function, and historical embeddings during training, our approach enables the model to adaptively mitigate the negative effects of stale embeddings, thereby reducing estimation errors and enhancing downstream accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in overcoming the staleness issue of existing historical embedding techniques, showcasing its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks, along with significantly faster convergence."}

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness."}

However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness.

Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers.

The boundary integral formulation employs a layered-medium Green's function to enforce transmission conditions across interfaces, thus avoiding unknowns on the interfaces and significantly reducing the size of the discretized problem compared to approaches that use a free-space Green's function. To demonstrate the FMM speedup, a low-order Nyström method is used to discretize the boundary integral equation and then the resulting dense linear system is solved by GMRES iterative solver accelerated by an improved layered media FMM and a overlapping domain decomposition preconditioning.

A key limitation of current training datasets is their reliance on sparse annotations mined from the Internet or entered via manual typing that capture only a fraction of an image's visual content. Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts. Our platform incorporates speech-to-text transcription and region-of-attention marking.

Specifically, we consider a multi-unit auction of identical items with single-minded bidders, where a subset of bidders may collude by coordinating bids and transferring payments and items among themselves. While the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism achieves efficient and truthful outcomes, it is highly vulnerable to collusion. In contrast, fully collusion-proof mechanisms are limited to posted-price formats, which fail to guarantee even approximate efficiency. This paper aims to bridge this gap by designing auctions that achieve good welfare and revenue guarantees even when some bidders collude. We first characterize the strategic behavior of colluding bidders under VCG and prove that such bidders optimally bid shade: they never overbid or take additional items, but instead reduce the auction price. This characterization enables a Bulow-Klemperer type result: adding colluding bidders can only improve welfare and revenue relative to running VCG on the non-colluding group alone. We then propose a Hybrid VCG (H-VCG) mechanism that combines VCG applied to non-colluding bidders with a posted-price mechanism for colluding bidders, assuming access to a black-box collusion detection algorithm. We show that H-VCG is ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and derive probabilistic guarantees on expected welfare and revenue under both known and unknown valuation distributions. Numerical experiments across several distributions demonstrate that H-VCG consistently outperforms VCG restricted to non-colluding bidders and approaches the performance of the ideal VCG mechanism assuming universal truthfulness.

Attention mechanisms provide an effective way for analyzing these intricate relationships. They can compute importance weights for information by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices to focus on pertinent values. However, existing attention-based feature selection methods predominantly focus on intra-view relationships, neglecting the complementarity of inter-view features and the critical feature-label correlations. Moreover, they often fail to account for feature redundancy, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method."}

We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability. Through extensive experiments, we find that MRMBench strongly correlates with the alignment performance of large language models (LLMs), making it a reliable reference for developing advanced reward models. Our analysis of MRMBench evaluation results reveals that reward models often struggle to capture preferences across multiple dimensions, highlighting the potential of multi-objective optimization in reward modeling.

Building on our earlier study, which collected keystroke data from 40 participants and trained a modified TypeNet model to detect assisted text, we expanded the dataset by adding 90 new participants and introducing a paraphrasing-based plagiarism-detection mode.

To further assess and improve robustness, we proposed a deception-based threat model simulating forged keystrokes and applied adversarial training as a countermeasure. Results show that the machine learning models achieve F1 scores above 97% in structured settings, while TypeNet performs best in detecting paraphrasing, with an F1 score of 86.9%.

However, this transition is hindered by fundamental limitations in conventional metasurface transmitter architectures, including restricted modulation orders, symbol-level spatial inconsistency, and significant harmonic interference. These issues stem from the intrinsic coupling between baseband signal processing and radio-frequency beamforming in monolithic designs reliant on simplistic switching mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA) that fundamentally decouples these functionalities. The MSA introduces a dual-stage up-conversion process, comprising a digital up-conversion module for in-phase/quadrature modulation and baseband-to-intermediate frequency conversion, a precoder module for precoding, and a custom-designed magnitude-phase-decoupled metasurface that acts as a reconfigurable reflective mixer array. This decoupling of harmonic-free waveform generation from spatial precoding overcomes the critical drawbacks of existing approaches. Experimental results from a 5.8 GHz proof-of-concept prototype system validate the MSA's superior performance. The system generates spatially isotropic constellations for arbitrary-order QAM modulations, ensures consistent time-frequency signatures for applications like Doppler-spoofing, and achieves data rates up to 20 Mbps within a linear operating region that minimizes nonlinear distortion. The capability of employing spatial diversity and multi-stream interference cancellation has been demonstrated for the first time in a PM-based transmitter."}

To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations. This function is integrated into a flexible plug-and-play framework that decouples the data-fidelity term from the diffusion prior, allowing any pretrained DM to act as a denoiser within the iterative reconstruction process.

It requires foresight to minimize overall changes to the clutter configuration while accessing target objects, avoiding stack destabilization and reducing the number of object removals required. Rule-based planners when applied to this problem, rely on rigid heuristics, leading to high computational overhead. End-to-end reinforcement learning approaches struggle with interpretability and generalizability over different conditions. To address these issues, we present ClutterNav, a novel decision-making framework that can identify the next best object to be removed so as to access a target object in a given clutter, while minimising stack disturbances. ClutterNav formulates the problem as a continuous reinforcement learning task, where each object removal dynamically updates the understanding of the scene. A removability critic, trained from demonstrations, estimates the cost of removing any given object based on geometric and spatial features. This learned cost is complemented by integrated gradients that assess how the presence or removal of surrounding objects influences the accessibility of the target. By dynamically prioritizing actions that balance immediate removability against long-term target exposure, ClutterNav achieves near human-like strategic sequencing, without predefined heuristics. The proposed approach is validated extensively in simulation and over real-world experiments. The results demonstrate real-time, occlusion-aware decision-making in partially observable environments."}

In contrast, masked image modeling (MIM) has demonstrated that masked regions can be reconstructed from partial input, revealing that even incomplete data can exhibit strong contextual consistency with the original image. This highlights the potential of masked regions as sources of semantic diversity. Motivated by this, we revisit the image masking approach, proposing to treat masked content as auxiliary knowledge rather than ignored. Based on this, we propose MaskAnyNet, which combines masking with a relearning mechanism to exploit both visible and masked information. It can be easily extended to any model with an additional branch to jointly learn from the recomposed masked region. This approach leverages the semantic diversity of the masked regions to enrich features and preserve fine-grained details. Experiments on CNN and Transformer backbones show consistent gains across multiple benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that the proposed method improves semantic diversity through the reuse of masked content."}

While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation."}

Identifying the true source of such anomalies, known as Root Cause Localization (RCL), is essential for timely mitigation. However, existing RCL approaches are designed for cloud environments and rely on centralized analysis, which increases latency and communication overhead when applied at the edge. This paper proposes a decentralized RCL approach that executes localization directly at the edge device level using the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm. The proposed method first groups microservices into communication- and colocation-aware clusters, thereby confining most anomaly propagation within cluster boundaries. Within each cluster, PPR is executed locally to identify the root cause, significantly reducing localization time. For the rare cases where anomalies propagate across clusters, we introduce an inter-cluster peer-to-peer approximation process, enabling lightweight coordination among clusters with minimal communication overhead. To enhance the accuracy of localization in heterogeneous edge environments, we also propose a novel anomaly scoring mechanism tailored to the diverse anomaly triggers that arise across microservice, device, and network layers. Evaluation results on the publicly available edge dataset, MicroCERCL, demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approach achieves comparable or higher localization accuracy than its centralized counterpart while reducing localization time by up to 34%. These findings highlight that decentralized graph-based RCL can provide a practical and efficient solution for anomaly diagnosis in resource-constrained edge environments."}

Operator-level analysis shows heterogeneous behavior: lexical substitutions offer the best yield-variance trade-off, semantic-similarity crossover acts as a precise low-throughput inserter, and global rewrites exhibit high variance with elevated refusal costs. Using elite prompts evolved on LLaMA 3.1 8B, we observe practically meaningful but attenuated cross-model transfer, with toxicity roughly halving on most targets, smaller LLaMA 3.2 variants showing the strongest resistance, and some cross-architecture models retaining higher toxicity. These results suggest that small, controllable perturbations are effective vehicles for systematic red-teaming and that defenses should anticipate cross-model reuse of adversarial prompts rather than focusing only on single-model hardening."}

To address this, we develop an uncover-and-unlearn approach. First, we uncover potential unwanted shifts between source and target domains by simulating them through predefined mappings and consider them as nuisances. Then, during test-time prediction, the model is enforced to unlearn these nuisances by regularizing the consequent shifts in latent representations and label predictions. Specifically, a mutual information-based criterion is devised and applied to guide nuisances unlearning in the feature space and encourage confident and consistent prediction in label space. Our proposed approach explicitly addresses agnostic domain shifts, enabling superior model generalization under FTTA constraints. Extensive experiments on various tasks, involving corruption and style shifts, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches."}

This setting is unrealistic because when certain labels are missing, the degrees of the remaining labels will increase accordingly. We fix this unrealistic setting in IncomLDL and raise a new problem: LDL with hidden labels (HidLDL), which aims to recover a complete label distribution from a real-world incomplete label distribution where certain labels in an instance are omitted during annotation. To solve this challenging problem, we discover the significance of proportional information of the observed labels and capture it by an innovative constraint to utilize it during the optimization process. We simultaneously use local feature similarity and the global low-rank structure to reveal the mysterious veil of hidden labels. Moreover, we theoretically give the recovery bound of our method, proving the feasibility of our method in learning from hidden labels.

C3DFusion performs enhanced temporal fusion through two complementary techniques-historical context blurring and current-centric feature densification-which suppress noise from inaccurately warped historical point features by attenuating their scale, and enhance current point features by increasing their volumetric contribution. Simply integrated into standard SSC architectures, C3DFusion demonstrates strong effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Furthermore, it exhibits robust generalization, achieving notable performance gains when applied to other baseline models."}

High-performance implementations typically rely on low-level HIP/CUDA communication libraries that demand substantial engineering effort for even basic overlap patterns, while simpler abstractions often sacrifice performance. We present Iris, a multi-GPU communication library implemented entirely in Python and Triton that eliminates this trade-off. Iris provides tile-based symmetric memory abstractions that naturally align with Triton's programming model, enabling developers to write single-source kernels that seamlessly interleave computation and communication. We demonstrate a taxonomy of compute-communication overlap patterns--from bulk-synchronous to fine-grained workgroup specialization--that can be implemented with minimal code changes in Iris, often requiring just a few additional lines within the same Triton kernel. Our evaluation shows that Iris achieves near-optimal bandwidth utilization in microbenchmarks and delivers up to 1.79x speedup over PyTorch and RCCL for GEMM+All-Scatter workloads, demonstrating that high-level implementations can match or exceed heavily-optimized libraries while dramatically simplifying multi-GPU programming."}

Wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) integrated with wireless power transfer (WPT) technology emerge as a transformative paradigm, theoretically enabling unlimited operational lifetime. In this paper, we investigate a heterogeneous mobile charging architecture that strategically combines automated aerial vehicles (AAVs) and ground smart vehicles (SVs) in complex terrain scenarios to collaboratively exploit the superior mobility of AAVs and extended endurance of SVs for optimal energy distribution. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously addresses the dynamic balance of heterogeneous charger advantages, charging efficiency versus mobility energy consumption trade-offs, and real-time adaptive coordination under time-varying network conditions. This problem presents significant computational challenges due to its high-dimensional continuous action space, non-convex optimization landscape, and dynamic environmental constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the improved heterogeneous agent trust region policy optimization (IHATRPO) algorithm that integrates a self-attention mechanism for enhanced complex environmental state processing and employs a Beta sampling strategy to achieve unbiased gradient computation in continuous action spaces. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that IHATRPO achieves a 39% performance improvement over the original HATRPO, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline algorithms while substantially increasing sensor node survival rate and charging system efficiency."}

However, these approaches result in elaborate pipelines or storage requirements that grow with the number of past observations. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for making structure-based relocalisation tractable. Instead of relying on image retrieval or search heuristics, we learn a direct mapping from image observations to the visible scene structure in a compact neural network. Given a query image, a forward pass through our novel visible structure retrieval network allows obtaining the subset of 3D structure points in the map that the image views, thus reducing the search space of 2D-3D correspondences. We show that our proposed method enables performing localisation with an accuracy comparable to the state of the art, while requiring lower computational and storage footprint."}

This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations."}

However, three challenges persist: 1) how to balance users' long-term and short-term interests , 2) noise interference when generating hierarchical semantic IDs (SIDs), 3) the absence of explicit modeling for negative feedback such as exposed items without clicks. To address these challenges, we propose DualGR, a generative retrieval framework that explicitly models dual horizons of user interests with selective activation.

Finally, we propose an Exposure-aware Next-Token Prediction Loss (ENTP-Loss) that treats \"exposed-but-unclicked\" items as hard negatives at level-1, enabling timely interest fade-out. On the large-scale Kuaishou short-video recommendation system, DualGR has achieved outstanding performance. Online A/B testing shows +0.527% video views and +0.432% watch time lifts, validating DualGR as a practical and effective paradigm for industrial generative retrieval."}

Implemented through a web-based survey, the method utilizes simple, user-generated geometric animations as intermediary artifacts to establish a correspondence between discrete emotion labels and the continuous valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) space. The approach involves a two-phase process: first, each participant creates an animation to represent a given emotion label (encoding); then, they immediately assess their own creation on the three VAD dimensions. The method was empirically validated and refined through two iterative user studies. The results confirmed the method's robustness.

To address these issues, we propose a one-stop degradation-aware image fusion framework for multi-degradation scenarios driven by a large language model (MdaIF). Given the distinct scattering characteristics of different degradation scenarios (e.g., haze, rain, and snow) in atmospheric transmission, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) system is introduced to tackle image fusion across multiple degradation scenarios.

Guided by the semantic prior, we propose degradation-aware channel attention module (DCAM), which employ degradation prototype decomposition to facilitate multi-modal feature interaction in channel domain.

Although many programming languages and frameworks exist, engineers still lack sufficient empirical evidence to guide the choice of tools for advanced industrial applications. This study addresses that need by measuring and comparing worst-case execution time (WCET) and development time across six languages and frameworks: C++, Java, Jade, Jason, and fuzzy Jason BDI with both loosely and tightly coupled integration. These technologies reflect a progression from procedural and object-oriented programming to agent-based frameworks capable of symbolic and fuzzy reasoning.\n  Rather than relying on broad concepts such as paradigms or orientations, the study adopts a developer-centred approach grounded in measurable outcomes. The structured comparison examines how rising abstraction levels and reasoning capabilities affect both development effort and runtime behaviour. By analysing these dimensions, the study highlights concrete trade-offs between engineering workload and execution efficiency.\n  The findings show how abstraction and reasoning mechanisms shape system performance and developer productivity, offering practical insight for designing intelligent, agent-based solutions that must operate under real-time constraints and complex decision-making requirements. Overall, the study contributes evidence-based guidance for selecting software technologies in industrial informatization, supporting improved integration efficiency, maintainability, and responsiveness, and laying groundwork for future research on the interplay between language features, development dynamics, and runtime behaviour in cyber-physical and smart manufacturing systems."}

However, applying them to fine-grained tasks presents a significant challenge: ensuring synthetic images accurately capture the subtle, category-defining features critical for high fidelity. Standard approaches, such as text-based Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), often lack the required specificity, potentially generating misleading examples that degrade fine-grained classifier performance. To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement. Experiments on several FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGFA."}

In this work, we introduce EmoVerse, a large-scale open-source dataset that enables interpretable visual emotion analysis through multi-layered, knowledge-graph-inspired annotations. By decomposing emotions into Background-Attribute-Subject (B-A-S) triplets and grounding each element to visual regions, EmoVerse provides word-level and subject-level emotional reasoning. With over 219k images, the dataset further includes dual annotations in Categorical Emotion States (CES) and Dimensional Emotion Space (DES), facilitating unified discrete and continuous emotion representation. A novel multi-stage pipeline ensures high annotation reliability with minimal human effort. Finally, we introduce an interpretable model that maps visual cues into DES representations and provides detailed attribution explanations. Together, the dataset, pipeline, and model form a comprehensive foundation for advancing explainable high-level emotion understanding."}

When the learning rate lies below this threshold, training is stable and the loss decreases monotonically. Yet, modern deep networks often achieve their best performance beyond this regime.\n  We demonstrate that such instabilities induce an implicit bias in GD, driving parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape and thereby improving generalization. The key mechanism is the Rotational Polarity of Eigenvectors (RPE), a geometric phenomenon in which the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian rotate during training instabilities. These rotations, which increase with learning rates, promote exploration and provably lead to flatter minima.\n  This theoretical framework extends to stochastic GD, where instability-driven flattening persists and its empirical effects outweigh minibatch noise. Finally, we show that restoring instabilities in Adam further improves generalization.\n  Together, these results establish and understand the constructive role of training instabilities in deep learning."}

To address these issues, we propose SEMC, a novel Structure-Enhanced Mixture-of-Experts Contrastive learning framework that combines structure-aware feature fusion with expert-guided contrastive learning.

Based on this paradigm, we introduce CLstega (\\textit{C}ontent-preserving \\textit{L}inguistic \\textit{stega}nography), a novel method that embeds secret messages through controllable distribution transformation.

To achieve this transformation, CLstega elaborately selects target words for embedding positions as labels to construct a masked sentence dataset, which is used to fine-tune the original MLM, producing a target MLM capable of directly extracting secret messages from the cover text. This approach ensures perfect security of secret messages while fully preserving the integrity of the original cover text. Experimental results show that CLstega can achieve a 100\\% extraction success rate, and outperforms existing methods in security, effectively balancing embedding capacity and security."}

Our goal is to enable fully automated aerial wildfire monitoring using autonomous drones, allowing for the early detection of ground fires before smoke or flames are visible. While synthetic aperture (SA) sensing mitigates occlusion from the canopy and sunlight, it introduces thermal blur that obscures the actual surface temperatures. To address this, we train a visual state space model to recover the subtle thermal signals of partially occluded soil and fire hotspots from this blurred data. A key challenge was the scarcity of real-world training data. We overcome this by integrating a latent diffusion model into a vector quantized to generated a large volume of realistic surface temperature simulations from real wildfire recordings, which we further expanded through temperature augmentation and procedural thermal forest simulation. On simulated data across varied ambient and surface temperatures, forest densities, and sunlight conditions, our method reduced the RMSE by a factor of 2 to 2.5 compared to conventional thermal and uncorrected SA imaging. In field experiments focused on high-temperature hotspots, the improvement was even more significant, with a 12.8-fold RMSE gain over conventional thermal and a 2.6-fold gain over uncorrected SA images. We also demonstrate our model's generalization to other thermal signals, such as human signatures for search and rescue. Since simple thresholding is frequently inadequate for detecting subtle thermal signals, the morphological characteristics are equally essential for accurate classification. Our experiments demonstrated another clear advantage: we reconstructed the complete morphology of fire and human signatures, whereas conventional imaging is defeated by partial occlusion."}

Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length. Empirical evaluations show that our method reduces length bias in reward assignment and leads to more concise, content-focused outputs from the policy model.

To overcome this limitation, we identify typographical attacks as a promising direction for protecting geo-privacy by adding text extension outside the visual content. We further investigate which textual semantics are effective in disrupting geolocation inference and design a two-stage, semantics-aware typographical attack that generates deceptive text to protect user privacy.

However, the task remains challenging due to the chromogen overlap, variable biomarker staining, and diverse cellular morphologies. Regression-based counting methods offer advantages over detection-based ones in handling overlapped cells, yet rarely support end-to-end multi-class counting. Moreover, the potential of foundation models remains largely underexplored in this paradigm. To address these limitations, we propose a rank-aware agglomeration framework that selectively distills knowledge from multiple strong foundation models, leveraging their complementary representations to handle IHC heterogeneity and obtain a compact yet effective student model, CountIHC. Unlike prior task-agnostic agglomeration strategies that either treat all teachers equally or rely on feature similarity, we design a Rank-Aware Teacher Selecting (RATS) strategy that models global-to-local patch rankings to assess each teacher's inherent counting capacity and enable sample-wise teacher selection. For multi-class cell counting, we introduce a fine-tuning stage that reformulates the task as vision-language alignment. Discrete semantic anchors derived from structured text prompts encode both category and quantity information, guiding the regression of class-specific density maps and improving counting for overlapping cells. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CountIHC surpasses state-of-the-art methods across 12 IHC biomarkers and 5 tissue types, while exhibiting high agreement with pathologists' assessments. Its effectiveness on H&E-stained data further confirms the scalability of the proposed method."}

It then samples reference points in RoI regions of the mask and applies cross-attention with BEV features to refine the query representations of each lane.RBTR models lane connectivity based on boundary-point query features and further employs a topological denoising strategy to reduce matching ambiguity.By integrating spatial and sequential priors into fine-grained queries and applying a denoising strategy to boundary-point topology reasoning, our method precisely models complex lane structures and delivers trustworthy topology predictions.Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TopoFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with an OLS of 48.0% on subsetA and 45.4% on subsetB."}

Inspired by the multi-scale modeling of classic Mask2Former-based models, we propose Seg-VAR, a novel framework that rethinks segmentation as a conditional autoregressive mask generation problem. This is achieved by replacing the discriminative learning with the latent learning process. Specifically, our method incorporates three core components: (1) an image encoder generating latent priors from input images, (2) a spatial-aware seglat (a latent expression of segmentation mask) encoder that maps segmentation masks into discrete latent tokens using a location-sensitive color mapping to distinguish instances, and (3) a decoder reconstructing masks from these latents. A multi-stage training strategy is introduced: first learning seglat representations via image-seglat joint training, then refining latent transformations, and finally aligning image-encoder-derived latents with seglat distributions. Experiments show Seg-VAR outperforms previous discriminative and generative methods on various segmentation tasks and validation benchmarks. By framing segmentation as a sequential hierarchical prediction task, Seg-VAR opens new avenues for integrating autoregressive reasoning into spatial-aware vision systems.

However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose Mind-inspired Recommender (MindRec), a novel generative framework that emulates human thought processes. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling flexible and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\\% average improvement in top-1 recommendation performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation accuracy.

Yet, other modalities such as agent positions and trajectories over time, i.e. tracking, remain comparatively under-explored despite being compact, agent-centric signals that explicitly encode spatial interactions. Understanding whether pixel (video) or position (tracking) modalities leads to better group activity recognition is therefore important to drive further research on the topic. However, no standardized benchmark currently exists that aligns broadcast video and tracking data for the same group activities, leading to a lack of apples-to-apples comparison between these modalities for GAR. In this work, we introduce SoccerNet-GAR, a multimodal dataset built from the $64$ matches of the football World Cup 2022. Specifically, the broadcast videos and player tracking modalities for $94{,}285$ group activities are synchronized and annotated with $10$ categories. Furthermore, we define a unified evaluation protocol to benchmark two strong unimodal approaches: (i) a competitive video-based classifiers and (ii) a tracking-based classifiers leveraging graph neural networks. In particular, our novel role-aware graph architecture for tracking-based GAR directly encodes tactical structure through positional edges and temporal attention. Our tracking model achieves $67.2\\%$ balanced accuracy compared to $58.1\\%$ for the best video baseline, while training $4.25 \\times$ faster with $438 \\times$ fewer parameters ($197K$ \\vs $86.3M$).

In real-world scenarios, models often encounter samples from unseen (out-of-distribution, OOD) categories. Misclassifying these as known (in-distribution, ID) classes not only degrades predictive accuracy but can also impair the adaptation process, leading to further errors on subsequent ID samples. Many existing TTA methods suffer substantial performance drops under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Ladder Network that extracts OOD features from class tokens aggregated across all Transformer layers. OOD detection performance is enhanced by combining the original model prediction with the output of the Hierarchical Ladder Network (HLN) via weighted probability fusion. To improve robustness under domain shift, we further introduce an Attention Affine Network (AAN) that adaptively refines the self-attention mechanism conditioned on the token information to better adapt to domain drift, thereby improving the classification performance of the model on datasets with domain shift. Additionally, a weighted entropy mechanism is employed to dynamically suppress the influence of low-confidence samples during adaptation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly improves the performance on the most widely used classification datasets."}

We show how to use them to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) explicitly discretized on a computational stencil. From this point of view, the QPU serves as a sampling accelerator. Each micro-kernel consumes only stencil inputs (neighbor values and coefficients), runs a shallow parameterized circuit, and reports the sample mean of a readout rule. The resource footprint in qubits and depth is fixed and independent of the global grid. This makes micro-kernels easy to orchestrate from a classical host and to parallelize across grid points. We present two realizations. The Bernoulli micro-kernel targets convex-sum stencils by encoding values as single-qubit probabilities with shot allocation proportional to stencil weights. The branching micro-kernel prepares a selector over stencil branches and applies addressed rotations to a single readout qubit. In contrast to monolithic quantum PDE solvers that encode the full space-time problem in one deep circuit, our approach keeps the classical time loop and offloads only local updates. Batching and in-circuit fusion amortize submission and readout overheads. We test and validate the QPU micro-kernel method on two PDEs commonly arising in scientific computing: the Heat and viscous Burgers' equations. On noiseless quantum circuit simulators, accuracy improves as the number of samples increases. On the IBM Brisbane quantum computer, single-step diffusion tests show lower errors for the Bernoulli realization than for branching at equal shot budgets, with QPU micro-kernel execution dominating the wall time."}

In view of this, we propose Segmented Exponent Alignment (SEA) and Dynamic Wordline Activation (DWA) strategies. SEA exploits the observation that input exponents are often clustered around zero or within a narrow range. By segmenting the exponent space and aligning mantissas accordingly, SEA eliminates the need for maximum exponent detection and reduces input mantissa shifting, and thus reduces the processing latency. DWA further reduces latency and maintains accuracy by activating wordlines based on the exponent segments defined by SEA.

To support this task, we construct Knots (Knowledge and NOTAM Semantics), a high-quality dataset of 12,347 expert-annotated NOTAMs covering 194 Flight Information Regions, enhanced through a multi-agent collaborative framework for comprehensive field discovery. We systematically evaluate a wide range of prompt-engineering strategies and model-adaptation techniques, achieving substantial improvements in aviation text understanding and processing. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and offer valuable insights for automated NOTAM analysis systems.

To address this challenge, we introduce MDiTFace--a customized diffusion transformer framework that employs a unified tokenization strategy to process semantic mask and text inputs, eliminating discrepancies between heterogeneous modality representations. The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDiTFace significantly outperforms other competing methods in terms of both facial fidelity and conditional consistency."}

Recent methods attempt to address this dilemma by regularizing high-dimensional latent spaces using external vision foundation models (VFMs). However, it remains unclear how high-dimensional VAE latents affect the optimization of generative models. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to reveal that redundant high-frequency components in high-dimensional latent spaces hinder the training convergence of diffusion models and, consequently, degrade generation quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a spectral self-regularization strategy to suppress redundant high-frequency noise while simultaneously preserving reconstruction quality. The resulting Denoising-VAE, a ViT-based autoencoder that does not rely on VFMs, produces cleaner, lower-noise latents, leading to improved generative quality and faster optimization convergence. We further introduce a spectral alignment strategy to facilitate the optimization of Denoising-VAE-based generative models. Our complete method enables diffusion models to converge approximately 2$\\times$ faster than with SD-VAE, while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (rFID = 0.28, PSNR = 27.26) and competitive generation performance (gFID = 1.82) on the ImageNet 256$\\times$256 benchmark."}

When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs."}

However, fine-tuning these models is resource-intensive due to their large number of parameters. Prompt tuning has emerged as a viable solution to mitigate memory usage and reduce training time while maintaining competitive performance. Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose incorporating LLMs into the prompt tuning process. Specifically, we introduce the CILMP, Conditional Intervention of Large Language Models for Prompt Tuning, a method that bridges LLMs and VLMs to facilitate the transfer of medical knowledge into VLM prompts. CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability. Extensive experiments across diverse medical image datasets demonstrate that CILMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

The first layer employs a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to detect anomalies by identifying traffic deviations from established normal patterns. The second layer employs Support Vector Machine to classify these anomalies as either threat anomalies or benign anomalies. Our Adaptive Dual Layer WAF incorporates comprehensive data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques and has been thoroughly evaluated using five large benchmark datasets.

Existing security schemes are unable to provide sub-10 ms (milliseconds) anomaly detection and distributed coordination of large-scale networks of vehicles within an acceptable safety/privacy framework. This paper introduces a three-tier hybrid security architecture HAVEN (Hierarchical Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Network), which decouples real-time local threat detection and distributed coordination operations. It incorporates a light ensemble anomaly detection model on the edge (first layer), Byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning to aggregate threat intelligence at a regional scale (middle layer), and selected blockchain mechanisms (top layer) to ensure critical security coordination. Extensive experimentation is done on a real-world autonomous driving dataset. Large-scale simulations with the number of vehicles ranging between 100 and 1000 and different attack types, such as sensor spoofing, jamming, and adversarial model poisoning, are conducted to test the scalability and resiliency of HAVEN. Experimental findings show sub-10 ms detection latency with an accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 92% across multimodal sensor data, Byzantine fault tolerance validated with 20\\% compromised nodes, and a reduced blockchain storage overhead, guaranteeing sufficient differential privacy. The proposed framework overcomes the important trade-off between real-time safety obligation and distributed security coordination with novel three-tiered processing.

We formalize CA-expressible languages as sets of finite words obtained by projecting the non-quiescent segments of configurations reachable by one-dimensional, deterministic, synchronous CA over bi-infinite grids. These languages are defined with respect to sets of initial configurations specified by a regular language as in regular model checking. To capture structured dynamics, we propose a glider-based generative semantics for CA. Inspired by the classical notion of gliders, we define a glider as a one-cell entity carrying a symbol in a certain velocity under well defined interaction semantics. We show that despite the regularity of the initial configurations and the locality of the transition rules, the resulting languages can exhibit non-regular and even non-context-free structure. This positions regular-initialized CA languages as a surprisingly rich computational model, with potential applications in the formal analysis of linearly ordered MAS."}

To tackle this issue, we propose Fourier Series-based Tampering Synthesis (FSTS), a structured and interpretable framework for synthesizing tampered text images. FSTS first collects 16,750 real-world tampering instances from five representative tampering types, using a structured pipeline that records human-performed editing traces via multi-format logs (e.g., video, PSD, and editing logs). By analyzing these collected parameters and identifying recurring behavioral patterns at both individual and population levels, we formulate a hierarchical modeling framework. Specifically, each individual tampering parameter is represented as a compact combination of basis operation-parameter configurations, while the population-level distribution is constructed by aggregating these behaviors. Since this formulation draws inspiration from the Fourier series, it enables an interpretable approximation using basis functions and their learned weights. By sampling from this modeled distribution, FSTS synthesizes diverse and realistic training data that better reflect real-world forgery traces. Extensive experiments across four evaluation protocols demonstrate that models trained with FSTS data achieve significantly improved generalization on real-world datasets.

This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning \"Houston\" from \"NASA\" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness. Its core is a Stage-aware Reward mechanism that provides dense supervision for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Decomposition, Sub-answer Correctness). Crucially, we identify that naive outcome-only RL is a deceptive trap for LLM alignment: it collapses reasoning integrity (e.g., 19.00% Hop acc) while superficially boosting final accuracy.

This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields.

But how can we trust that a generated image truly reflects the intended transformation? Evaluating its reliability remains a major challenge. While recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches, have significantly improved NVS quality, existing evaluation metrics struggle to assess whether a generated image is both realistic and faithful to the source view and intended viewpoint transformation. Standard metrics, such as pixel-wise similarity and distribution-based measures, often mis-rank incorrect results as they fail to capture the nuanced relationship between the source image, viewpoint change, and generated output. We propose a task-aware evaluation framework that leverages features from a strong NVS foundation model, Zero123, combined with a lightweight tuning step to enhance discrimination.

This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount."}

However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines.

Hallucination detectability is highest for unified-fusion models with dense visual tokenization (Qwen2.5-VL) and lowest for architectures with restricted tokenization (Med-Gemma). Embedding-based clustering often yields stronger separation when applied directly to the generated answers, whereas NLI-based clustering remains advantageous for LLaVA-Med and for longer, sentence-level responses. Across configurations, the VASE metric consistently provides the most robust hallucination signal, especially when paired with embedding clustering and a moderate sampling budget (n ~ 10-15).

To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks.

This failure stems from a fundamental architectural limitation where backbone networks encode occluding surfaces rather than target objects, thereby corrupting the feature representations required for accurate enumeration. To address this, we present CountOCC, an amodal counting framework that explicitly reconstructs occluded object features through hierarchical multimodal guidance. Rather than accepting degraded encodings, we synthesize complete representations by integrating spatial context from visible fragments with semantic priors from text and visual embeddings, generating class-discriminative features at occluded locations across multiple pyramid levels. We further introduce a visual equivalence objective that enforces consistency in attention space, ensuring that both occluded and unoccluded views of the same scene produce spatially aligned gradient-based attention maps. Together, these complementary mechanisms preserve discriminative properties essential for accurate counting under occlusion. For rigorous evaluation, we establish occlusion-augmented versions of FSC 147 and CARPK spanning both structured and unstructured scenes. CountOCC achieves SOTA performance on FSC 147 with 26.72% and 20.80% MAE reduction over prior baselines under occlusion in validation and test, respectively. CountOCC also demonstrates exceptional generalization by setting new SOTA results on CARPK with 49.89% MAE reduction and on CAPTUREReal with 28.79% MAE reduction, validating robust amodal counting across diverse visual domains.

However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions."}

Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail."}

However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations.

We focus on set membership queries -- among the most fundamental forms of reasoning -- using tasks like ``Is apple an element of the set \\{pear, plum, apple, raspberry\\}?''. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation across prompt phrasing, semantic structure, element ordering, and model choice.

In this work, we conduct the first study of backdoor attacks on OVODs and reveal a new attack surface introduced by prompt tuning. We propose TrAP (Trigger-Aware Prompt tuning), a multi-modal backdoor injection strategy that jointly optimizes prompt parameters in both image and text modalities along with visual triggers. TrAP enables the attacker to implant malicious behavior using lightweight, learnable prompt tokens without retraining the base model weights, thus preserving generalization while embedding a hidden backdoor. We adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively shrinks the trigger size, enabling effective backdoor activation using small trigger patches at inference.

A puzzling issue is the fact that visual tokens most related to the query receive little to no attention in the final layers of the LLM module of VLMs from the answer tokens, where all tokens are treated equally, in particular, visual and language tokens in the LLM attention layers. This fact may result in wrong answers to visual questions, as our experimental results confirm. It appears that the standard next-token prediction (NTP) loss provides an insufficient signal for directing attention to visual tokens. We hypothesize that a more direct supervision of the attention of visual tokens to corresponding language tokens in the LLM module of VLMs will lead to improved performance on visual tasks. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we propose a novel loss function that directly supervises the attention of visual tokens. It directly grounds the answer language tokens in images by directing their attention to the relevant visual tokens. This is achieved by aligning the attention distribution of visual tokens to ground truth attention maps with KL divergence. The ground truth attention maps are obtained from task geometry in synthetic cases or from standard grounding annotations (e.g., bounding boxes or point annotations) in real images, and are used inside the LLM for attention supervision without requiring new labels. The obtained KL attention loss (KLAL) when combined with NTP encourages VLMs to attend to relevant visual tokens while generating answer tokens. This results in notable improvements across geometric tasks, pointing, and referring expression comprehension on both synthetic and real-world data, as demonstrated by our experiments. We also introduce a new dataset to evaluate the line tracing abilities of VLMs. Surprisingly, even commercial VLMs do not perform well on this task."}

ProxyPrints acts as a transparent middleware layer between the fingerprint scanner and the matching algorithm, transforming each scanned fingerprint into a consistent, unlinkable alias. This transformation allows biometric identities to be revoked and replaced in the event of a breach, without affecting authentication accuracy. Additionally, ProxyPrints provides organizations with breach detection capabilities by enabling the identification of out-of-band spoofing attempts involving compromised aliases.\n  We evaluate ProxyPrints on standard benchmark datasets and commercial fingerprint recognition systems, demonstrating that it preserves matching performance while offering strong security and revocability.

In our study, the targets include bark, leaf, soil, and miscellaneous materials. We propose a multi-target regression approach in the context of imbalanced learning using Kernel Point Convolutions (KPConv). Our research leverages cost-sensitive learning to address class imbalance called density-based relevance (DBR). We employ weighted Mean Saquared Erorr (MSE), Focal Regression (FocalR), and regularization to improve the optimization of KPConv. This study performs a sensitivity analysis on the voxel size (0.25 - 2 meters) to evaluate the effect of various grid representations in capturing the nuances of the forest. This sensitivity analysis reveals that larger voxel sizes (e.g., 2 meters) result in lower errors due to reduced variability, while smaller voxel sizes (e.g., 0.25 or 0.5 meter) exhibit higher errors, particularly within the canopy, where variability is greatest. For bark and leaf targets, error values at smaller voxel size datasets (0.25 and 0.5 meter) were significantly higher than those in larger voxel size datasets (2 meters), highlighting the difficulty in accurately estimating within-canopy voxel content at fine resolutions. This suggests that the choice of voxel size is application-dependent.

In this paper, we empirically analyze the latent space dynamics of self-consuming diffusion models and observe that the low-dimensional structure of latent representations extracted from synthetic data degrade over generations. Based on this insight, we propose \\textit{Latent Space Filtering} (LSF), a novel approach that mitigates model collapse by filtering out less realistic synthetic data from mixed datasets. Theoretically, we present a framework that connects latent space degradation to empirical observations.

To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments.

Our insight is that many challenges associated with saliency-guided training stem from the placement of the guidance approaches solely within the image space. Instead, we move away from the image space, use the model's latent space embeddings to steer human guidance during training, and we propose SAGE (Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings): a loss function that integrates human saliency into network training using contrastive embeddings. We apply salient-preserving and saliency-degrading signal augmentations to the input and capture the changes in embeddings and model logits. We guide the model towards salient features and away from non-salient features using a contrastive triplet loss. Additionally, we perform a sanity check on the logit distributions to ensure that the model outputs match the saliency-based augmentations. We demonstrate a boost in classification performance across both open- and closed-set scenarios against SOTA saliency-based methods, showing SAGE's effectiveness across various backbones, and include experiments to suggest its wide generalization across tasks."}

The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. The architecture supports structured priors, enabling interpretable and mechanism-aware prediction as well as efficient active learning. DIVIDE is demonstrated on synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches with nonlinear spatial fields, on FerroSIM spin lattice simulations of ferroelectric patterns, and on experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films.

A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks."}

This paper introduces \"History Swapping,\" a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior."}

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions.

In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates."}

Typical DA strategies in the literature include collecting additional data in the target domain or re-training the model, or both. Both these strategies quickly become impractical as we increase scale and complexity of driving. These limitations have encouraged investigation into few-shot and zero-shot prompt-driven DA at inference time involving LLMs and VLMs. These methods work by adding a few state-action trajectories during inference to the prompt (similar to in-context learning). However, there are two limitations of such an approach: $(i)$ prompt-driven DA methods are currently restricted to perception tasks such as detection and segmentation and $(ii)$ they require expert few-shot data. In this work, we present a new approach to inference-time few-shot prompt-driven DA for closed-loop autonomous driving in adverse weather condition using in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). Similar to other prompt-driven DA methods, our approach does not require any updates to the model parameters nor does it require additional data collection in adversarial weather regime. Furthermore, our approach advances the state-of-the-art in prompt-driven DA by extending to closed driving using general trajectories observed during inference. Our experiments using the CARLA simulator show that ICRL results in safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in the target domain compared to state-of-the-art prompt-driven DA baselines."}

This inspired the novel observation that these embeddings can naturally be interpreted as point clouds in a Wasserstein space rather than as matrices in a Euclidean space. This perspective opens up new possibilities for understanding the geometry of embedding space. For example, when interpolating between embeddings of two distinct prompts, we propose reframing the interpolation problem as an optimal transport problem. By solving this optimal transport problem, we compute a shortest path (or geodesic) between embeddings that captures a more natural and geometrically smooth transition through the embedding space. This results in smoother and more coherent intermediate (interpolated) images when rendered by the Stable Diffusion generative model. We conduct experiments to investigate this effect, comparing the quality of interpolated images produced using optimal transport to those generated by other standard interpolation methods. The novel optimal transport--based approach presented indeed gives smoother image interpolations, suggesting that viewing the embeddings as point clouds (rather than as matrices) better reflects and leverages the geometry of the embedding space."}

Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria."}

Prior work, such as that of Wei et al., demonstrated these phenomena under model and data scaling, with transitions revealed after applying a log scale to training compute. In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors"}

Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency.

We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm.

While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning."}

Previous methods tried to solve this problem by actively gathering multiple views before grasp pose generation. However, they either overlooked the importance of the grasp distribution for information gain estimation or relied on the projection of the grasp distribution, which ignores the structure of grasp poses on the SE(3) manifold. To tackle these challenges, we propose a calibrated energy-based model for grasp pose generation and an active view selection method that estimates information gain from grasp distribution. Our energy-based model captures the multi-modality nature of grasp distribution on the SE(3) manifold. The energy level is calibrated to the success rate of grasps so that the predicted distribution aligns with the real distribution. The next best view is selected by estimating the information gain for grasp from the calibrated distribution conditioned on the reconstructed environment, which could efficiently drive the robot to explore affordable parts of the target object.

This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?\n  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models.

Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence."}

In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\\text{LTL}_f[\\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties.

Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare."}

We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.

While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs."}

However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling. These results advance the understanding of KANs' strengths and limitations, offering practical insights for continual learning system design."}

Any interference with this fundamental right requires a legal basis, which has existed for many years for traditional communication services in the form of telecommunications surveillance (TKÜ, § 100a StPO) and appears to be widely accepted by society. The basis for the implementation of TKÜ is the obligation of telecommunications providers to provide interception interfaces. However, the technical implementation of telecommunications has changed significantly as a result of the Internet. Messenger services and Voice over IP telephony are increasingly competing with traditional telephone services. The use of strong end-to-end encryption made possible by this technology is increasingly posing problems for law enforcement agencies, as only cryptographically encrypted content is accessible via the interception interfaces provided to date. Against the backdrop of current discussions on socalled ``chat control'' and its limited social acceptance, this article addresses the question of whether and, if so, how the cooperation obligations of the technical actors involved can be sensibly regulated in the case of encrypted communication."}

We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement.

We propose \\textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \\emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \\emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9). This study demonstrates that high expressivity and scalability are not mutually exclusive: principled, topology-guided sparsification enables powerful, efficient GNNs with theoretical guarantees."}

To address this gap, we investigate: (1) What PPMs have academics proposed, and how are these PPMs evaluated? (2) What PPMs do manufacturers document and what factors affect these documentation? To address these questions, we conduct a two-phase study, synthesizing a systematic review of 117 academic papers with an empirical analysis of 86 SHDs' publicly disclosed documentations. Our review of academic literature reveals a strong focus on novel system- and algorithm-based PPMs. However, these proposals neglect deployment barriers (e.g., cost, interoperability), and lack real-world field validation and legal analysis. Concurrently, our analysis of commercial SHDs finds that advanced academic proposals are absent from public discourse. Industry postures are fundamentally reactive, prioritizing compliance via post-hoc data management (e.g., deletion options), rather than the preventative controls favored by academia. The documented protections correspondingly converge on a small set of practical mechanisms, such as physical buttons and localized processing. By synthesizing these findings, we advocate for research to analyze challenges, provide deployable frameworks, real-world field validation, and interoperability solutions to advance practical PPMs."}

However, imitation learning of interactive policies that coordinate with humans in shared spaces without explicit communication remains challenging, due to the significantly higher behavioral complexity in multi-agent interactions compared to non-interactive tasks. In this work, we introduce a structured imitation learning framework for interactive policies by combining generative single-agent policy learning with a flexible yet expressive game-theoretic structure. Our method explicitly separates learning into two steps: first, we learn individual behavioral patterns from multi-agent demonstrations using standard imitation learning; then, we structurally learn inter-agent dependencies by solving an inverse game problem. Preliminary results in a synthetic 5-agent social navigation task show that our method significantly improves non-interactive policies and performs comparably to the ground truth interactive policy using only 50 demonstrations. These results highlight the potential of structured imitation learning in interactive settings."}

Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth.

This paper argues that considering human-centric aspects is an essential dimension of dependability, and presents a human-centred RE process designed to integrate social responsibility into critical system development. Drawing from a literature review, we identified a set of guidelines for designing software for vulnerable communities and translated these into sixty-two functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements were operationalised through the design of an adaptive early warning system prototype, which was subsequently evaluated through six interviews and eight cognitive walkthroughs to validate their relevance and applicability.

The paper concludes by positioning human-centricity not as an ethical add-on but as a defining quality of safe and equitable critical systems."}

Serving such models on conventional hardware is challenging due to limited DRAM capacity and high GPU costs. Thus, in this work, we propose offloading the single-batch token generation to a 3D NAND flash processing-in-memory (PIM) device, leveraging its high storage density to overcome the DRAM capacity wall. We explore 3D NAND flash configurations and present a re-architected PIM array with an H-tree network for optimal latency and cell density. Along with the well-chosen PIM array size, we develop operation tiling and mapping methods for LLM layers, achieving a 2.4x speedup over four RTX4090 with vLLM and comparable performance to four A100 with only 4.9% latency overhead. Our detailed area analysis reveals that the proposed 3D NAND flash PIM architecture can be integrated within a 4.98mm2 die area under the memory array, without extra area overhead."}

Classical Data Shapley (DS) provides a essential axiomatic framework for data valuation but is constrained by its symmetry axiom that assumes interchangeability of data sources. This assumption fails to capture the directional and temporal dependencies prevalent in modern ML/AI workflows, including the reliance of duplicated or augmented data on original sources and the order-specific contributions in sequential pipelines such as federated learning and multi-stage LLM fine tuning. To address these limitations, we introduce Asymmetric Data Shapley (ADS), a structure-aware data valuation framework for modern ML/AI pipelines. ADS relaxes symmetry by averaging marginal contributions only over permutations consistent with an application-specific ordering of data groups. It preserves efficiency and linearity, maintains within group symmetry and directional precedence across groups, and reduces to DS when the ordering collapses to a single group. We develop two complementary computational procedures for ADS: (i) a Monte Carlo estimator (MC-ADS) with finite-sample accuracy guarantees, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbor surrogate (KNN-ADS) that is exact and efficient for KNN predictors. Across representative settings with directional and temporal dependence, ADS consistently outperforms benchmark methods by distinguishing novel from redundant contributions and respecting the sequential nature of training. These results establish ADS as a principled and practical approach to equitable data valuation in data markets and complex ML/AI pipelines."}

Using vCoT, we systematically compare image-only LVLMs with their video-finetuned counterparts, both with and without access to these transitional cues. Our experiments show that vCoT significantly improves the performance of image-only models on long-form video question answering, while yielding only marginal gains for video-finetuned models.

While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention."}

While existing approaches in multi-view setups with fully overlapping sensors benefit from consistent view coverage, partially overlapping settings where actions are visible in only a subset of views remain underexplored. This challenge becomes more severe in real-world scenarios, as many systems provide only limited input modalities and rely on sequence-level annotations instead of dense frame-level labels. In this study, we propose View-aware Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ViCoKD), a framework that distills knowledge from a fully supervised multi-modal teacher to a modality- and annotation-limited student. ViCoKD employs a cross-modal adapter with cross-modal attention, allowing the student to exploit multi-modal correlations while operating with incomplete modalities. Moreover, we propose a View-aware Consistency module to address view misalignment, where the same action may appear differently or only partially across viewpoints. It enforces prediction alignment when the action is co-visible across views, guided by human-detection masks and confidence-weighted Jensen-Shannon divergence between their predicted class distributions. Experiments on the real-world MultiSensor-Home dataset show that ViCoKD consistently outperforms competitive distillation methods across multiple backbones and environments, delivering significant gains and surpassing the teacher model under limited conditions."}

Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., \"how to interact\"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., \"when to interact\") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks.

Local side information shapes per-agent risk models for consumption, which are coupled through chance constraints on failures. A lightweight consensus-ADMM routine coordinates agents over a sparse communication graph, enabling near-centralized performance while avoiding single points of failure. We validate the framework on real urban road networks with autonomous vehicles and on a representative satellite constellation, comparing against greedy, no-side-information, and oracle central baselines. Our method reduces failure rates by 30-55% at matched cost and scales to thousands of agents with near-linear runtime, while preserving feasibility with high probability."}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for automatic and interpretable creativity assessment from drawings. Motivated by the cognitive understanding that creativity can emerge from both what is drawn (content) and how it is drawn (style), we reinterpret the creativity score as a function of these two complementary dimensions.Specifically, we first augment an existing creativity labeled dataset with additional annotations targeting content categories. Based on the enriched dataset, we further propose a multi-modal, multi-task learning framework that simultaneously predicts creativity scores, categorizes content types, and extracts stylistic features. In particular, we introduce a conditional learning mechanism that enables the model to adapt its visual feature extraction by dynamically tuning it to creativity-relevant signals conditioned on the drawing's stylistic and semantic cues.Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing regression-based approaches and offers interpretable visualizations that align well with human judgments.

However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios."}

Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training."}

ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment. Training employs a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, where the original VAR model supervises the learning of routing and gating policies to align with pretrained knowledge.

Capturing the complete degree-of-freedom of force is imperative for accurate force measurement with six-axis force/torque sensors. However, cross-axis coupling can lead to calibration issues and decreased accuracy. In this instance, developing a soft and accurate six-axis sensor is a challenging task. In this paper, a soft air-chamber type six-axis force/torque sensor with 16-channel barometers is introduced, which housed in hyper-elastic air chambers made of silicone rubber. Additionally, an effective decoupling method is proposed, based on a rigid-soft hierarchical structure, which reduces the six-axis decoupling problem to two three-axis decoupling problems. Finite element model simulation and experiments demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed approach with reality. The prototype's sensing performance is quantitatively measured in terms of static load response, dynamic load response and dynamic response characteristic. It possesses a measuring range of 50 N force and 1 Nm torque, and the average deviation, repeatability, non-linearity and hysteresis are 4.9$\\%$, 2.7$\\%$, 5.8$\\%$ and 6.7$\\%$, respectively. The results indicate that the prototype exhibits satisfactory sensing performance while maintaining its softness due to the presence of soft air chambers."}

Current UAD methods typically utilize artificially generated noise perturbations on healthy MRIs to train generative models for normal anatomy reconstruction, enabling anomaly detection via residual mapping. However, such simulated anomalies lack the biophysical fidelity and morphological complexity characteristic of true clinical lesions. To advance UAD in brain MRI, we conduct the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of pathological signatures, revealing two key properties: (1) anomalies exhibit unique frequency patterns distinguishable from normal anatomy, and (2) low-frequency signals maintain consistent representations across healthy scans. These insights motivate our Frequency-Decomposition Preprocessing (FDP) framework, the first UAD method to leverage frequency-domain reconstruction for simultaneous pathology suppression and anatomical preservation. FDP can integrate seamlessly with existing anomaly simulation techniques, consistently enhancing detection performance across diverse architectures while maintaining diagnostic fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FDP consistently improves anomaly detection performance when integrated with existing methods. Notably, FDP achieves a 17.63% increase in DICE score with LDM while maintaining robust improvements across multiple baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ls1rius/MRI_FDP."}

The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.\n  We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.\n  Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively."}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in genral domains, the current state of research in sports remains narrowly focused: existing approaches are either single-sport centric, limited to specific tasks, or rely on training-free paradigms that lack robust, learned reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce DeepSport, the first end-to-end trained MLLM framework designed for multi-task, multi-sport video understanding. DeepSport shifts the paradigm from passive frame processing to active, iterative reasoning, empowering the model to ``think with videos'' by dynamically interrogating content via a specialized frame-extraction tool. To enable this, we propose a data distillation pipeline that synthesizes high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories from 10 diverse data source, creating a unified resource of 78k training data. We then employ a two-stage training strategy, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel gated tool-use reward, to optimize the model's reasoning process. Extensive experiments on the testing benchmark of 6.7k questions demonstrate that DeepSport achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines of both proprietary model and open-source models.

However, many approaches are specifically designed for anomaly detection tasks, which limits their generalizability to other 3D understanding tasks. In contrast, self-supervised point cloud models aim for general-purpose representation learning, yet our investigation reveals that these classical models are suboptimal at anomaly detection under the unified fine-tuning paradigm. This motivates us to develop a more generalizable 3D model that can effectively detect anomalies without relying on task-specific designs. Interestingly, we find that using only the curvature of each point as its anomaly score already outperforms several classical self-supervised and dedicated anomaly detection models, highlighting the critical role of curvature in 3D anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a Curvature-Augmented Self-supervised Learning (CASL) framework based on a reconstruction paradigm. Built upon the classical U-Net architecture, our approach introduces multi-scale curvature prompts to guide the decoder in predicting the spatial coordinates of each point. Without relying on any dedicated anomaly detection mechanisms, it achieves leading detection performance through straightforward anomaly classification fine-tuning.

Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint vel- ocity constraints, which can result in degraded control perfor- mance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications."}

Furthermore, leveraging foundation models to reduce the sim2real gap via intermediate representations fails to mitigate the domain shift fully and adds computational overhead during deployment. This work confronts dual challenges of data inefficiency and deployment complexity. We propose DiffuDepGrasp, a deploy-efficient sim2real framework enabling zero-shot transfer through simulation-exclusive policy training. Its core innovation, the Diffusion Depth Generator, synthesizes geometrically pristine simulation depth with learned sensor-realistic noise via two synergistic modules. The first Diffusion Depth Module leverages temporal geometric priors to enable sample-efficient training of a conditional diffusion model that captures complex sensor noise distributions, while the second Noise Grafting Module preserves metric accuracy during perceptual artifact injection.

CoS enhances LLM by formulating the schedule task into three atomic stages, i.e., exploration, verification and integration. Then we enable the LLMs to generate CoS autonomously via Knowledge Distillation (KD).

CoordAR formulates 3D-3D correspondences between the reference and query views as a map of discrete tokens, which is obtained in an autoregressive and probabilistic manner. To enable accurate correspondence regression, CoordAR introduces 1) a novel coordinate map tokenization that enables probabilistic prediction over discretized 3D space; 2) a modality-decoupled encoding strategy that separately encodes RGB appearance and coordinate cues; and 3) an autoregressive transformer decoder conditioned on both position-aligned query features and the partially generated token sequence.

Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines."}

This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs. This has enabled the successful deployment of AIF in the Taobao display advertising system."}

Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48$\\times$ speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach."}

By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization.

Since industrial anomalies are semantically subtle and current methods do not sufficiently exploit image priors, direct clustering approaches often perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose ProtoAnomalyNCD, a prototype-learning-based framework for discovering unseen anomaly classes of multiple types that can be integrated with various anomaly detection methods. First, to suppress background clutter, we leverage Grounded SAM with text prompts to localize object regions as priors for the anomaly classification network. Next, because anomalies usually appear as subtle and fine-grained patterns on the product, we introduce an Anomaly-Map-Guided Attention block. Within this block, we design a Region Guidance Factor that helps the attention module distinguish among background, object regions, and anomalous regions. By using both localized product regions and anomaly maps as priors, the module enhances anomalous features while suppressing background noise and preserving normal features for contrastive learning. Finally, under a unified prototype-learning framework, ProtoAnomalyNCD discovers and clusters unseen anomaly classes while simultaneously enabling multi-type anomaly classification. We further extend our method to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the MVTec AD, MTD, and Real-IAD datasets."}

Impressive progress has been achieved by learning-based algorithms which require LDR-HDR image pairs. However, these pairs are hard to obtain, which motivates researchers to delve into the problem of annotation-efficient HDR image reconstructing: how to achieve comparable performance with limited HDR ground truths (GTs). This work attempts to address this problem from the view of semi-supervised learning where a teacher model generates pseudo HDR GTs for the LDR samples without GTs and a student model learns from pseudo GTs. Nevertheless, the confirmation bias, i.e., the student may learn from the artifacts in pseudo HDR GTs, presents an impediment. To remove this impediment, an uncertainty-based masking process is proposed to discard unreliable parts of pseudo GTs at both pixel and patch levels, then the trusted areas can be learned from by the student. With this novel masking process, our semi-supervised HDR reconstructing method not only outperforms previous annotation-efficient algorithms, but also achieves comparable performance with up-to-date fully-supervised methods by using only 6.7% HDR GTs."}

Specifically, a diffusion model incorporating LSTM with attention achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art RNN blocks, such as TTT and Mamba2. Moreover, existing diffusion-RNN approaches often suffer from performance degradation due to training-inference gap or the lack of overlap across windows. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Recurrent Autoregressive Diffusion (RAD) framework, which executes frame-wise autoregression for memory update and retrieval, consistently across training and inference time. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate the superiority of RAD for long video generation, highlighting the efficiency of LSTM in sequence modeling."}

To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances.

However, this domain faces two key challenges: (1) spatial constraints, driven by the requirements of the local-life scenario, where items are usually shown only to users within a limited geographic area, indirectly reducing their exposure probability; and (2) long-tail sparsity, where few popular items dominate user interactions, while many high-quality long-tail items are largely overlooked due to imbalanced interaction opportunities. Existing methods typically adopt a user-centric perspective, such as modeling spatial user preferences or enhancing long-tail representations with collaborative filtering signals. However, we argue that an item-centric perspective is more suitable for this domain, focusing on enhancing long-tail items representation that align with the spatially-constrained characteristics of local lifestyle services. To tackle this issue, we propose ReST, a Plug-And-Play Spatially-Constrained Representation Enhancement Framework for Long-Tail Local-Life Recommendation. Specifically, we first introduce a Meta ID Warm-up Network, which initializes fundamental ID representations by injecting their basic attribute-level semantic information.

This design adaptively identifies weak ID representations based on their attribute-level information during training.

The sequence of a user's historical questions provides a rich, implicit signal of evolving interests and cognitive patterns, yet leveraging this temporal data for predictive tasks remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between language modeling and behavioral sequence modeling.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a Collaborative Filtering-enhanced Question Prediction (CFQP) framework. CFQP dynamically models evolving user-question interactions by integrating personalized memory modules with graph-based preference propagation. This dual mechanism allows the system to adaptively learn from user-specific histories while refining predictions through collaborative signals from similar users.

Existing techniques primarily focus on code-level trace alignment through fuzzing, which is both time-consuming and insufficient for handling environment-level failures. Moreover, they often fall short when dealing with complicated triggering condition changes across versions. To overcome this, we propose Diffploit, an iterative, diff-driven exploit migration method structured around two key modules: the Context Module and the Migration Module. The Context Module dynamically constructs contexts derived from analyzing behavioral discrepancies between the target and reference versions, which capture the failure symptom and its related diff hunks. Leveraging these contexts, the Migration Module guides an LLM-based adaptation through an iterative feedback loop, balancing exploration of diff candidates and gradual refinement to resolve reproduction failures effectively. We evaluate Diffploit on a large-scale dataset containing 102 Java CVEs and 689 version-migration tasks across 79 libraries. Diffploit successfully migrates 84.2% exploits, outperforming the change-aware test repair tool TARGET by 52.0% and the rule-based tool in IDEA by 61.6%.

To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection.

Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks."}

Recently, neural networks trained with {\\tt mixup} that linearly interpolates random examples from the training set have shown better calibration in supervised settings. However, calibration of neural models remains under-explored in semi-supervised settings. Although effective in supervised model calibration, random mixup of pseudolabels in SSL presents challenges due to the overconfidence and unreliability of pseudolabels. In this work, we introduce CalibrateMix, a targeted mixup-based approach that aims to improve the calibration of SSL models while maintaining or even improving their classification accuracy. Our method leverages training dynamics of labeled and unlabeled samples to identify ``easy-to-learn'' and ``hard-to-learn'' samples, which in turn are utilized in a targeted mixup of easy and hard samples.

To overcome these limitations, we propose HiFusion, a novel deep learning framework that integrates two complementary components.

However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection.\n  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search."}

This problem can be especially challenging when: 1) the reference image is captured from an arbitrary viewpoint, and 2) the robot must operate with sparse-view scene reconstructions. In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image. Extensive experiments in photorealistic home and real-world environments validate the higher performance of SplatSearch against current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Success Rate and Success Path Length.

Preprint", "summary": "Most neural network quantization methods apply uniform bit precision across spatial regions, ignoring the heterogeneous structural and textural complexity of visual data. This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image. Cross-dataset validation on COCO and Pascal VOC further confirms consistent performance gains, indicating that morphology-driven spatial quantization can enhance efficiency and robustness for computationally constrained, safety-critical visual recognition tasks."}

However, most existing 3D assets in simulation are rigid, and manually converting them into articulated objects is extremely labor- and cost-intensive. This raises a natural question: can we automatically identify articulable objects in a scene and convert them into articulated assets directly? In this paper, we present ArtiWorld, a scene-aware pipeline that localizes candidate articulable objects from textual scene descriptions and reconstructs executable URDF models that preserve the original geometry. At the core of this pipeline is Arti4URDF, which leverages 3D point cloud, prior knowledge of a large language model (LLM), and a URDF-oriented prompt design to rapidly convert rigid objects into interactive URDF-based articulated objects while maintaining their 3D shape. We evaluate ArtiWorld at three levels: 3D simulated objects, full 3D simulated scenes, and real-world scan scenes. Across all three settings, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving object geometry and correctly capturing object interactivity to produce usable URDF-based articulated models. This provides a practical path toward building interactive, robot-ready simulation environments directly from existing 3D assets. Code and data will be released."}

We introduce Cluster-based Concept Importance (CCI), a novel interpretability method that uses CLIP's own patch embeddings to group spatial patches into semantically coherent clusters, mask them, and evaluate relative changes in model predictions. CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging CCI with COVAR, we present a comprehensive evaluation of eighteen CLIP variants, offering methodological advances and empirical evidence that chart a path toward more robust VLMs."}

Dataset pruning addresses this challenge by constructing a compact but informative coreset from the full dataset with comparable performance. Previous approaches typically establish scoring metrics based on specific criteria to identify representative samples. However, these methods predominantly rely on sample scores obtained from the model's performance during the training (i.e., fitting) phase. As scoring models achieve near-optimal performance on training data, such fitting-centric approaches induce a dense distribution of sample scores within a narrow numerical range. This concentration reduces the distinction between samples and hinders effective selection. To address this challenge, we conduct dataset pruning from the perspective of generalization, i.e., scoring samples based on models not exposed to them during training. We propose a plug-and-play framework, UNSEEN, which can be integrated into existing dataset pruning methods. Additionally, conventional score-based methods are single-step and rely on models trained solely on the complete dataset, providing limited perspective on the importance of samples. To address this limitation, we scale UNSEEN to multi-step scenarios and propose an incremental selection technique through scoring models trained on varying coresets, and optimize the quality of the coreset dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K.

However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness. Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation.

However, audit artifacts are heterogeneous and often lack reproducible, executable PoC tests suitable for automated validation, leading to costly, ad hoc manual verification. Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to turn audit reports into PoC test cases, but have three major challenges: noisy inputs, hallucinations, and missing runtime oracles. In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively. Applied to the latest Etherscan verified-source corpus, SmartPoC confirms 236 real bugs out of 545 audit findings at a cost of only $0.03 per finding."}

However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o."}

By preserving full 3D context, it efficiently processes multiple native-resolution masks in parallel, enhancing multi-class segmentation performance. A lightweight 3D convolutional module enables precise voxel-space refinement guided by both prompt types, supporting up to 243 classes across CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and microscopy modalities in the BiomedSegFM dataset.

For 24-class segmentation, parallel spatial prompting reduces inference time by more than 90% compared to sequential prompting. We propose dynamic resampling to address target-patch ratio imbalance, extending SAT and nnU-Net for data augmentation. Furthermore, we develop optimized text preprocessing, a two-stage inference strategy, and post-processing techniques to improve memory efficiency, precision, and inference speed.

However, CLIP models often develop multimodal spurious biases, which is the undesirable tendency to rely on spurious features. For example, CLIP may infer object types in images based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than the object's core features. This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets and five popular backbone models demonstrate that SAGE consistently improves zero-shot performance and generalization, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches without any external knowledge or model updates."}

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data."}

Real scenes and transmission components are modeled by 3D Gaussians and the reflection components are modeled by the mirrored Gaussians with respect to the reflection plane. The transmission and reflection components are blended according to a Fresnel-based, view-dependent weighting scheme, allowing for faithful synthesis of complex appearance effects under varying viewpoints.

While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN."}

Standard 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines fail when applied directly to underexposed inputs, as independent enhancement across views causes illumination inconsistencies and geometric distortion. To address this, we present DTGS, a unified framework that tightly couples Retinex-inspired illumination decomposition with thermal-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for illumination-invariant reconstruction. Unlike prior approaches that treat enhancement as a pre-processing step, DTGS performs joint optimization across enhancement, geometry, and thermal supervision through a cyclic enhancement-reconstruction mechanism. A thermal supervisory branch stabilizes both color restoration and geometry learning by dynamically balancing enhancement, structural, and thermal losses. Moreover, a Retinex-based decomposition module embedded within the 3DGS loop provides physically interpretable reflectance-illumination separation, ensuring consistent color and texture across viewpoints. To evaluate our method, we construct RGBT-LOW, a new multi-view low-light thermal dataset capturing severe illumination degradation. Extensive experiments show that DTGS significantly outperforms existing low-light enhancement and 3D reconstruction baselines, achieving superior radiometric consistency, geometric fidelity, and color stability under extreme illumination."}

Motivated by this insight, we propose BP-FPN, a backpropagation-driven feature pyramid architecture that fundamentally rethinks feature learning for small target. BP-FPN introduces Gradient-Isolated Low-Level Shortcut (GILS) to efficiently incorporate fine-grained target details without inducing shortcut learning, and Directional Gradient Regularization (DGR) to enforce hierarchical feature consistency during backpropagation.

In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts.

While quantization has proven effective for LLMs, its applicability to SLMs is significantly underexplored, with critical questions about differing quantization bottlenecks and efficiency profiles. This paper introduces SLMQuant, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM compression techniques when applied to SLMs. Through comprehensive multi-track evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks, we analyze how state-of-the-art quantization methods perform on SLMs. Our findings reveal fundamental disparities between SLMs and LLMs in quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that direct transfer of LLM-optimized techniques leads to suboptimal results due to SLMs' unique architectural characteristics and training dynamics. We identify key factors governing effective SLM quantization and propose actionable design principles for SLM-tailored compression. SLMQuant establishes a foundational framework for advancing efficient SLM deployment on low-end devices in edge applications, and provides critical insights for deploying lightweight language models in resource-constrained scenarios."}

However, when directly applied to long-form video understanding scenarios, they exhibit clear limitations. The fundamental reasons for this lie in two points: (1)long-form video understanding involves richer and more dynamic visual input, meaning rethinking only the text information is insufficient and necessitates a further rethinking process specifically targeting visual information; (2) purely text-based reflection mechanisms lack cross-modal interaction capabilities, preventing them from fully integrating visual information during reflection. Motivated by these insights, we propose REVISOR (REflective VIsual Segment Oriented Reasoning), a novel framework for tool-augmented multimodal reflection. REVISOR enables MLLMs to collaboratively construct introspective reflection processes across textual and visual modalities, significantly enhancing their reasoning capability for long-form video understanding. To ensure that REVISOR can learn to accurately review video segments highly relevant to the question during reinforcement learning, we designed the Dual Attribution Decoupled Reward (DADR) mechanism. Integrated into the GRPO training strategy, this mechanism enforces causal alignment between the model's reasoning and the selected video evidence. Notably, the REVISOR framework significantly enhances long-form video understanding capability of MLLMs without requiring supplementary supervised fine-tuning or external models, achieving impressive results on four benchmarks including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and LVBench."}

We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity.

The evaluation measures a model's Omniscience Index, a bounded metric (-100 to 100) measuring factual recall that jointly penalizes hallucinations and rewards abstention when uncertain, with 0 equating to a model that answers questions correctly as much as it does incorrectly.

To address this limitation, we propose Ocean, an object-centric prediction framework that decomposes the scene into individual object instances to enable more accurate semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight segmentation model, MobileSAM, to extract instance masks from the input image.

To handle segmentation errors and missing instances, we further design a Global Similarity-Guided Attention module that leverages segmentation features for global interaction. Finally, we propose an Instance-aware Local Diffusion module that improves instance features through a generative process and subsequently refines the scene representation in the BEV space.

To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment.

Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform.

To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Grained Category-Aware Network (MGCA-Net) comprising a localizer, an action presence predictor, a conventional classifier, and a coarse-to-fine classifier. Specifically, the localizer localizes category-agnostic action proposals. For these action proposals, the action presence predictor estimates the probability that they belong to an action instance. At the same time, the conventional classifier predicts the probability of each action proposal over base action categories at the snippet granularity. Novel action categories are recognized by the coarse-to-fine classifier, which first identifies action presence at the video granularity. Finally, it assigns each action proposal to one category from the coarse categories at the proposal granularity. Through coarse-to-fine category awareness for novel actions and the conventional classifier's awareness of base actions, multi-grained category awareness is achieved, effectively enhancing localization performance. Comprehensive evaluations on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models.

However, CF-based methods often encounter biases due to imbalances in training data. This phenomenon makes CF-based methods tend to prioritize recommending popular items and performing unsatisfactorily on inactive users. Existing works address this issue by rebalancing training samples, reranking recommendation results, or making the modeling process robust to the bias. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches can compromise accuracy or be sensitive to weighting strategies, making them challenging to train. In this paper, we deeply analyze the causes and effects of the biases and propose a framework to alleviate biases in recommendation from the perspective of representation distribution, namely Group-Alignment and Global-Uniformity Enhanced Representation Learning for Debiasing Recommendation (AURL). Specifically, we identify two significant problems in the representation distribution of users and items, namely group-discrepancy and global-collapse. These two problems directly lead to biases in the recommendation results. To this end, we propose two simple but effective regularizers in the representation space, respectively named group-alignment and global-uniformity. The goal of group-alignment is to bring the representation distribution of long-tail entities closer to that of popular entities, while global-uniformity aims to preserve the information of entities as much as possible by evenly distributing representations. Our method directly optimizes both the group-alignment and global-uniformity regularization terms to mitigate recommendation biases. Extensive experiments on three real datasets and various recommendation backbones verify the superiority of our proposed framework."}

This article puts forward a general and systematic post-processing algorithm for A* and other graph-search-based planners. The A* post-processing algorithm, called APP, is developed based on the costmap, which is widely used in commercial service robots. First, a bidirectional vertices reduction algorithm is proposed to tackle the asymm- etry of the path and the environments. During the forward and backward vertices reduction, a thorough shortcut strategy is put forward to improve the path-shortening performance and avoid unnecessary heading changes. Second, an iterative path perturbation algorithm is adopted to locally reduce the number of unnecessary heading changes and improve the path smooth- ness. Comparative experiments are then carried out to validate the superiority of the proposed method.

To overcome this challenge, the research community is looking more and more at Graph Machine Learning (GML) as it offers a powerful alternative by using relationships within data. However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models."}

A unidirectional road network is built to represent the traffic constraints in semi-structured environments and a hybrid strategy is proposed to achieve a guaranteed planning result.Cutting across the road at the starting and the goal points are allowed to achieve a shorter path.

Direct training of SNNs typically relies on surrogate gradient (SG) learning to estimate derivatives of non-differentiable spiking activity. However, during training, the distribution of neuronal membrane potentials varies across timesteps and progressively deviates toward both sides of the firing threshold. When the firing threshold and SG remain fixed, this may lead to imbalanced spike firing and diminished gradient signals, preventing SNNs from performing well. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stage synergistic learning algorithm that achieves forward adaptive thresholding and backward dynamic SG. In forward propagation, we adaptively adjust thresholds based on the distribution of membrane potential dynamics (MPD) at each timestep, which enriches neuronal diversity and effectively balances firing rates across timesteps and layers. In backward propagation, drawing from the underlying association between MPD, threshold, and SG, we dynamically optimize SG to enhance gradient estimation through spatio-temporal alignment, effectively mitigating gradient information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements. Moreover, it allows neurons to fire stable proportions of spikes at each timestep and increases the proportion of neurons that obtain gradients in deeper layers."}

However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects."}

We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design."}

In video tasks, such strategies frequently underutilize rich visual information, leading to potential shortcut learning and increased susceptibility to hallucination. To foster a more robust, visual-centric video understanding, we start by introducing a novel self-supervised reinforcement learning GRPO algorithm (Pretext-GRPO) within the standard R1 pipeline, in which positive rewards are assigned for correctly solving pretext tasks on transformed visual inputs, which makes the model to non-trivially process the visual information. Building on the effectiveness of Pretext-GRPO, we further propose the ViSS-R1 framework, which streamlines and integrates pretext-task-based self-supervised learning directly into the MLLM's R1 post-training paradigm. Instead of relying solely on sparse visual cues, our framework compels models to reason about transformed visual input by simultaneously processing both pretext questions (concerning transformations) and true user queries. This necessitates identifying the applied transformation and reconstructing the original video to formulate accurate final answers. Comprehensive evaluations on six widely-used video reasoning and understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our Pretext-GRPO and ViSS-R1 for complex video reasoning. Our codes and models will be publicly available."}

Specifically, 3D lanes are projected onto the front-view (FV) space and approximated by parametric curves. Guided by curve predictions, curve-point query embeddings are dynamically generated for lane point predictions in 3D space. Each segment formed by two adjacent points is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, parameterized by the local structure and uncertainty estimations. Accordingly, a novel 3D Gaussian matching loss is designed to constrain these parameters jointly. Experiments on the ONCE-3DLanes and OpenLane datasets demonstrate that MonoUnc outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods across all benchmarks under stricter evaluation criteria.

This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning."}

Specifically, we propose a novel framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), which is pre-trained on natural images, to the EM domain. We first use SAM2 to extract powerful, general-purpose features. To bridge the domain gap, we introduce a Feature-Guided Attention module that leverages semantic cues from SAM2 to guide a lightweight encoder, the Fine-Grained Encoder (FGE), in focusing on these challenging regions.

Objective: This study aims to analyze these research gaps in the context of GenAI-enabled software systems. It seeks to establish a coherent perspective for a systematic analysis of responsibility gaps from a human oversight requirements standpoint, encompassing how these responsibility gaps should be conceptualized, identified, and represented throughout the RE process. Methods: The proposed design methodology is structured across three analytical layers. At the conceptualization layer, it establishes a conceptual framing that defines the key elements of responsibility across the human and system dimensions and explains how potential responsibility gaps emerge from their interactions. At the methodological layer, it introduces a deductive pipeline for identifying responsibility gaps by analyzing interactions between these dimensions and deriving corresponding oversight requirements within established RE frameworks. At the artifact layer, it formalizes the results in a Deductive Backbone Table, a reusable representation that traces the reasoning path from responsibility gaps identification to human oversight requirements derivation. Results: A user study compared the proposed methodology with a baseline goal-oriented RE across two scenarios. Evaluation across six dimensions indicated clear improvements of the proposed methodology, confirming its effectiveness in addressing three research gaps."}

However, existing architectures remain constrained by an over-reliance on ego status, hindering generalization and robust scene understanding. We identify the root cause as an inherent design within these architectures that allows ego status to be easily leveraged as a shortcut. Specifically, the premature fusion of ego status in the upstream BEV encoder allows an information flow from this strong prior to dominate the downstream planning module. To address this challenge, we propose AdaptiveAD, an architectural-level solution based on a multi-context fusion strategy. Its core is a dual-branch structure that explicitly decouples scene perception and ego status. One branch performs scene-driven reasoning based on multi-task learning, but with ego status deliberately omitted from the BEV encoder, while the other conducts ego-driven reasoning based solely on the planning task. A scene-aware fusion module then adaptively integrates the complementary decisions from the two branches to form the final planning trajectory. To ensure this decoupling does not compromise multi-task learning, we introduce a path attention mechanism for ego-BEV interaction and add two targeted auxiliary tasks: BEV unidirectional distillation and autoregressive online mapping. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that AdaptiveAD achieves state-of-the-art open-loop planning performance. Crucially, it significantly mitigates the over-reliance on ego status and exhibits impressive generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios."}

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability.

To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks.

The effectiveness of this integration critically depends on accurate alignment between the sensor reference frames. Standard model-based alignment methods between these sensor systems suffer from lengthy convergence times, dependence on prescribed motion patterns, and reliance on external aiding sensors, significantly limiting operational flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper presents ResAlignNet, a data-driven approach using the 1D ResNet-18 architecture that transforms the alignment problem into deep neural network optimization, operating as an in-situ solution that requires only sensors on board without external positioning aids or complex vehicle maneuvers, while achieving rapid convergence in seconds. Additionally, the approach demonstrates the learning capabilities of Sim2Real transfer, enabling training in synthetic data while deploying in operational sensor measurements. Experimental validation using the Snapir autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrates that ResAlignNet achieves alignment accuracy within 0.8° using only 25 seconds of data collection, representing a 65\\% reduction in convergence time compared to standard velocity-based methods. The trajectory-independent solution eliminates motion pattern requirements and enables immediate vehicle deployment without lengthy pre-mission procedures, advancing underwater navigation capabilities through robust sensor-agnostic alignment that scales across different operational scenarios and sensor specifications."}

In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

However, the substantial training and storage costs associated with these datasets hinder their practical deployment. While dataset distillation (DD) can alleviate these burdens, existing methods mainly target high-level tasks, where multiple samples share the same label. This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data.

We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis.

Furthermore, to better learn the common degenerate representation of haze in spatial variations, we propose an unsupervised dehaze method for implicit neural degradation representation. Firstly, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a mechanism combining the channel-independent and channel-dependent mechanisms, which efficiently enhances the ability to learn from nonlinear dependencies. which in turn achieves good visual perception in complex scenes. Moreover, we design an implicit neural representation to model haze degradation as a continuous function to eliminate redundant information and the dependence on explicit feature extraction and physical models. To further learn the implicit representation of the haze features, we also designed a dense residual enhancement module from it to eliminate redundant information. This achieves high-quality image restoration. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive dehaze performance on various public and real-world datasets.

Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions.

We implement and evaluate two representative models-ConvLSTM and Vanilla Transformer-on the Azerbaijani Sign Language Dataset (AzSLD) and the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset. Our results demonstrate that the attention-based Vanilla Transformer consistently outperforms the recurrent ConvLSTM in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy across datasets, achieving up to 76.8% Top-1 accuracy on AzSLD and 88.3% on WLASL. The ConvLSTM, while more computationally efficient, lags in recognition accuracy, particularly on smaller datasets. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of each paradigm: the Transformer excels in overall accuracy and signer independence, whereas the ConvLSTM offers advantages in computational efficiency and temporal modeling. The study provides a nuanced analysis of these trade-offs, offering guidance for architecture selection in sign language recognition systems depending on application requirements and resource constraints."}

Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models."}

In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations."}

Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.\n  To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance."}

However, existing methods rely on axis-aligned scanning within a fixed window, inevitably discarding spatial information. To address this problem, we propose WinMamba, a novel Mamba-based 3D feature-encoding backbone composed of stacked WinMamba blocks. To enhance the backbone with robust multi-scale representation, the WinMamba block incorporates a window-scale-adaptive module that compensates voxel features across varying resolutions during sampling.

In personalized FL, the goal shifts from training a single global model to creating tailored models for each client. In our framework, clients transmit highly compressed one-bit sketches, and the server aggregates and broadcasts a global one-bit consensus. To enable effective personalization, we introduce a sign-based regularizer that guides local models to align with the global consensus while preserving local data characteristics. To mitigate the computational burden of random sketching, we employ the Fast Hadamard Transform for efficient projection. Theoretical analysis guarantees that our algorithm converges to a stationary neighborhood of the global potential function. Numerical simulations demonstrate that pFed1BS substantially reduces communication costs while achieving competitive performance compared to advanced communication-efficient FL algorithms."}

Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions."}

In this work, we take a bold departure from text-based paradigms by introducing the first skeleton-driven pretraining framework for ReID. To achieve this, we propose Contrastive Skeleton-Image Pretraining for ReID (CSIP-ReID), a novel two-stage method that leverages skeleton sequences as a spatiotemporally informative modality aligned with video frames. In the first stage, we employ contrastive learning to align skeleton and visual features at sequence level.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSIP-ReID achieves new state-of-the-art results on standard video ReID benchmarks (MARS, LS-VID, iLIDS-VID). Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization to skeleton-only ReID tasks (BIWI, IAS), significantly outperforming previous methods.

During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy.

Our proposed approach models per-process energy profiles by leveraging fine-grained process-level resource metrics collected via eBPF and perf, which are synchronized with node-level energy measurements obtained from an attached power distribution unit.

The underlying rationale is that these abstractions, and specifically the belief-desire-intention architecture that is aligned with human practical reasoning, match more closely with people's everyday experience in interacting with other agents and artifacts in the real world. On top of this, we designed and implemented a visual programming system for agents that hides the technicalities of agent-oriented programming using a blocks-based visual development environment that is built on the JaCaMo platform.

Although deep learning has achieved great success in many cross-modal tasks, its performance on SAR-Optical registration tasks is still unsatisfactory. Gradient-based information has traditionally played a crucial role in handcrafted descriptors by highlighting structural differences. However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset. In addition, SOMA exhibits strong robustness and generalizes well across diverse scenes and resolutions."}

Specifically, we perform diffusion only on the residual map, allowing the network to focus more effectively on high-frequency information restoration. We then introduce wavelet-based downsampling in place of standard CNN downsampling to achieve multi-scale frequency decomposition, enabling sparse cross-attention between the high-frequency subbands of the pre-super-resolved image and the low-frequency subbands of the diffused image for explicit high-frequency guidance. Moreover, a Dynamic Thresholding Block (DTB) is designed to refine high-frequency selection during the sparse attention process.

However, numerical simulation methods suffer from high computational cost, long run-times that prevent real-time use, while conventional Machine learning (ML) models struggle to extract spatiotemporal features for long-horizon prediction and fail to decouple thermo-mechanical fields. This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas. The performance of PINO surrogate model highlights its potential for real-time long-horizon physics field prediction in controlling defects."}

Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators. Results are based on MarianMT, T5-Base and NLLB-200 translators."}

Local tractography methods, which construct streamlines by following local fiber orientation estimates stepwise through an image, are prone to error accumulation and high false positive rates, particularly on noisy or low-resolution data. In contrast, global methods, which attempt to optimize a collection of streamlines to maximize compatibility with underlying fiber orientation estimates, are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we introduce GenTract, the first generative model for global tractography. We frame tractography as a generative task, learning a direct mapping from dMRI to complete, anatomically plausible streamlines. We compare both diffusion-based and flow matching paradigms and evaluate GenTract's performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, GenTract achieves precision 2.1x higher than the next-best method, TractOracle. This advantage becomes even more pronounced in challenging low-resolution and noisy settings, where it outperforms the closest competitor by an order of magnitude. By producing tractograms with high precision on research-grade data while also maintaining reliability on imperfect, lower-resolution data, GenTract represents a promising solution for global tractography."}

Queries in XMC are associated with relevant labels from extremely large label spaces, where it is critical to strike a balance between efficiency and performance. Therefore, many recent approaches efficiently pose XMC as a maximum inner product search between embeddings learned from small encoder-only transformer architectures. In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable. Furthermore, our Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) efficiently integrates foundation vision models by pooling a single embedding per image. This limits computational growth while unlocking multi-modal capabilities. Remarkably, ViXML with small encoders outperforms text-only decoder in most cases, showing that an image is worth billions of parameters. Finally, we present an extension of existing text-only datasets to exploit visual metadata and make them available for future benchmarking.

Existing approaches primarily rely on spatially grounded supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, yet we observe that such models often exhibit query-locked reasoning, focusing narrowly on objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt while ignoring critical contextual cues. To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene. We further design a rollout-based training pipeline that jointly leverages vanilla and region-noisy videos to optimize spatial reasoning trajectories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: our 3B-parameter model achieves 47.5% accuracy on VSI-Bench, outperforming several 7B baselines.

In this work, we present a differentiable stroke reconstruction framework that unifies painting, stylized texturing, and smudging to faithfully reproduce the human painting-smudging loop. Given an input image, our framework first optimizes single- and dual-color Bezier strokes through a parallel differentiable paint renderer, followed by a style generation module that synthesizes geometry-conditioned textures across diverse painting styles. We further introduce a differentiable smudge operator to enable natural color blending and shading. Coupled with a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, our method jointly optimizes stroke geometry, color, and texture under geometric and semantic guidance.

We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K.

The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both \"how\" motion evolves and \"what\" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns."}

In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy.

Specifically, during the training, our proposed dynamic attention policy (DAP) employs the Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) module to represent the alignment as learnable fine-grained token-to-point attentions. To optimize these attentions across different tasks and geometric hierarchies, our DAP further exploits the Monte Carlo tree search to dynamically calibrate HAF attention weights via a hybrid reward signal and further enhances the alignment between textual descriptions and local 3D geometry. During the inference, our 3DAlign-DAER introduces an Efficient Retrieval Strategy (ERS) to leverage efficient hierarchical searching in the large-scale embedding spaces, outperforming traditional methods (e.g., KNN) in accuracy and efficiency.

In such scenarios, accurate odometry estimation is a preliminary requirement for stable locomotion, localization, and mapping. Traditional proprioceptive approaches, which rely on leg kinematics sensor modalities and inertial sensing, suffer from irrepressible vertical drift caused by frequent contact impacts, foot slippage, and vibrations, particularly affected by inaccurate roll and pitch estimation. Existing methods incorporate exteroceptive sensors such as LiDAR or cameras. Further enhancement has been introduced by leveraging gravity vector estimation to add additional observations on roll and pitch, thereby increasing the accuracy of vertical pose estimation. However, these approaches tend to degrade in feature-sparse or repetitive scenes and are prone to errors from double-integrated IMU acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose GaRLILEO, a novel gravity-aligned continuous-time radar-leg-inertial odometry framework. GaRLILEO decouples velocity from the IMU by building a continuous-time ego-velocity spline from SoC radar Doppler and leg kinematics information, enabling seamless sensor fusion which mitigates odometry distortion. In addition, GaRLILEO can reliably capture accurate gravity vectors leveraging a novel soft S2-constrained gravity factor, improving vertical pose accuracy without relying on LiDAR or cameras. Evaluated on a self-collected real-world dataset with diverse indoor-outdoor trajectories, GaRLILEO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly in vertical odometry estimation on stairs and slopes.

We address the question of whether there exist energy functionals with a clear physical interpretation whose stationary points, the zeros of their first variation, correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz problem. Starting from Hamilton's principle for the wave equation, we derive time-harmonic energies. The resulting functionals are generally indefinite. As a next step, we construct strongly coercive augmentations of these indefinite functionals that preserve their physical interpretation. Finally, we show how these variational principles lead to practical numerical methods based on finite element spaces and neural network architectures."}

As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark.

To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth.

In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order.

These agents can reason about market dynamics, forecast future demand, and adjust strategies accordingly. Unlike conventional model-based simulations, which are typically constrained to predefined rules, LLM-MAS supports broader and more adaptive behavior selection through natural language reasoning. We evaluated the framework via simulation experiments using three distribution-based metrics: (1) the number of purchases per dataset, (2) the number of purchases per buyer, and (3) the number of repeated purchases of the same dataset.

Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes. We also find they have moderate self-inconsistency in how they respond to challenges by users to given answers.

Furthermore, we construct the multimodal misinformation reasoning (MMR) dataset, encompasses more than 8K image-text pairs with both reasoning processes and classification labels, to make progress in the relam of multimodal misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMD-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark datasets, while maintaining flexible inference and token usage.

Existing evaluation methods, adapted from textual model editing, overstate success by relying on low-similarity or random inputs, obscure overfitting.

We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals. Token analysis shows edits disproportionately affect textual tokens. We propose locality-aware adversarial losses to balance cross-modal representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing transient blindness and improving locality by 17% on average."}

Most predictors of experimental observables are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with gradient-based conditional sampling.

We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts. These results establish chemical shift guided structure generation as feasible, expose key weaknesses in current predictors, and showcase a general strategy for incorporating diverse experimental signals.

In the proposed system, a sender transmits textual information to a receiver, while a potential eavesdropper attempts to intercept the information. At the sender side, the text is initially preprocessed, where each sentence is annotated with its corresponding topic, and subsequently extracted into a knowledge graph. To achieve the secure transmission of the knowledge graph, we propose a channel encryption scheme that integrates constellation diagonal transformation with multi-parameter weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). At the receiver side, the textual data is first decrypted, and then recovered via a transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the probability of information compromise. The legitimate receiver achieves a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.9, whereas the BLEU score of the eavesdropper remains below 0.3.

Recent methods typically focus on the geometric structure of objects, producing grasps with diverse hand poses and plausible contact points. However, these approaches often overlook the physical attributes of the grasp, specifically the contact force, leading to reduced stability of the grasp. In this paper, we focus on stable grasp generation using explicit contact force predictions. First, we define a force-aware contact representation by transforming the normal force value into discrete levels and encoding it using a one-hot vector. Next, we introduce force-aware stability constraints. We define the stability problem as an acceleration minimization task and explicitly relate stability with contact geometry by formulating the underlying physical constraints. Finally, we present a pose optimizer that systematically integrates our contact representation and stability constraints to enable stable grasp generation. We show that these constraints can help identify key contact points for stability which provide effective initialization and guidance for optimization towards a stable grasp. Experiments are carried out on two public benchmarks, showing that our method brings about 20% improvement in stability metrics and adapts well to novel objects."}

These routers can exploit their own MLLMs to mine this data, violating user privacy. Existing privacy perturbations fail the critical dual challenge of this scenario: protecting PII from the router's MLLM while simultaneously preserving task utility for the agent's MLLM. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Task Adversarial Protector (DualTAP), a novel framework that, for the first time, explicitly decouples these conflicting objectives. DualTAP trains a lightweight generator using two key innovations: (i) a contrastive attention module that precisely identifies and targets only the PII-sensitive regions, and (ii) a dual-task adversarial objective that simultaneously minimizes a task-preservation loss (to maintain agent utility) and a privacy-interference loss (to suppress PII leakage). To facilitate this study, we introduce PrivScreen, a new dataset of annotated mobile screenshots designed specifically for this dual-task evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) demonstrate DualTAP's state-of-the-art protection. It reduces the average privacy leakage rate by 31.6 percentage points (a 3.0x relative improvement) while, critically, maintaining an 80.8% task success rate - a negligible drop from the 83.6% unprotected baseline. DualTAP presents the first viable solution to the privacy-utility trade-off in mobile MLLM agents."}

Previous research has transformed reference images with salient objects into one-dimensional prompts, yielding significant results. We explore ways to enhance performance through multi-context fusion of rich salient image features and camouflaged object features. Therefore, we propose RFMNet, which utilizes features from multiple encoding stages of the reference salient images and performs interactive fusion with the camouflage features at the corresponding encoding stages. Given that the features in salient object images contain abundant object-related detail information, performing feature fusion within local areas is more beneficial for detecting camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose an Overlapped Windows Cross-attention mechanism to enable the model to focus more attention on the local information matching based on reference features.

The proposed methodology integrates three sequential stages: Sharpe-ratio-based universe selection, liquidity-adjusted mean-variance optimization, and multi-layered risk management implemented within an automated trading bot. Using daily price and volume data from 2023 to 2025 across the A-share universe, the framework dynamically identifies stocks exhibiting strong risk-adjusted performance while accounting for trading frictions and liquidity asymmetries that are common in emerging markets. Empirical backtests reveal that the proposed strategy achieves an annualized return of 25 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.71, and a maximum drawdown of 8.2 percent. These results significantly outperform the Buy-and-Hold benchmark, which records an annualized return of 21 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.62, and a drawdown of 7.6 percent over the same period. The superior performance demonstrates that incorporating risk-adjusted selection and liquidity-aware constraints enhances both profitability and stability, enabling the portfolio to capture upside potential while maintaining drawdown resilience. Beyond its empirical success, this study contributes methodologically by bridging classical mean-variance theory with practical liquidity adjustments and dynamic Sharpe-based screening. The resulting system not only improves the tradability of optimized portfolios but also provides a scalable and adaptive framework for quantitative asset allocation in liquidity-sensitive markets, offering new evidence that disciplined risk-return optimization can outperform passive investment strategies in the post-2023 Chinese equity landscape."}

In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance.

By leveraging anthropometric priors on human height and depth cues from a monocular depth estimator, DTO solves for a scene-consistent placement of all subjects within a principled Maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Applying DTO to the 4D-Humans dataset, we construct DTO-Humans, a new large-scale pGT dataset of 0.56M high-quality, scene-consistent multi-person images, featuring dense crowds with an average of 4.8 persons per image. Furthermore, we propose Metric-Aware HMR, an end-to-end network that directly estimates human mesh and camera parameters in metric scale. This is enabled by a camera branch and a novel relative metric loss that enforces plausible relative scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on relative depth reasoning and human mesh recovery. Code and data will be released publicly."}

Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) approaches often overlook these characteristics, resulting in uninformative and redundant visual representations. To address these issues, we aim to generate visual features that are both informative and compact to improve table understanding. We first propose progressive question conditioning, which injects the question into Vision Transformer layers with gradually increasing frequency, considering each layer's capacity to handle additional information, to generate question-aware visual features. To reduce redundancy, we introduce a pruning strategy that discards background tokens, thereby improving efficiency. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we further propose token focusing, a training strategy that encourages the model to concentrate essential information in the retained tokens. By combining these approaches, we present TabFlash, an efficient and effective MLLM for table understanding. TabFlash achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, while requiring 27% less FLOPs and 30% less memory usage compared to the second-best MLLM."}

To address this issue, we present SkyReels-Text, a novel font-controllable framework for precise poster text editing. Our method enables simultaneous editing of multiple text regions, each rendered in distinct typographic styles, while preserving the visual appearance of non-edited regions. Notably, our model requires neither font labels nor fine-tuning during inference: users can simply provide cropped glyph patches corresponding to their desired typography, even if the font is not included in any standard library. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including handwrittent text benchmarks, SkyReels-Text achieves state-of-the-art performance in both text fidelity and visual realism, offering unprecedented control over font families, and stylistic nuances.

However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks."}

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios."}

This strategy utilises the voltage signal directly as the sensing input, eliminating the need for traditional sensing modules and thereby reducing system complexity and energy consumption. A bi-objective optimisation framework is proposed to maximise both power output and damage detection accuracy of a PEH modelled as a composite cantilevered Kirchhoff-Love plate. Voltage responses under realistic bridge inputs are predicted via isogeometric analysis. The approach is validated in two scenarios: a numerical vehicle-bridge interaction model and a laboratory-scale beam test using a toy car, each evaluated in both healthy and damaged states. Unsupervised damage detection is achieved using a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained solely on healthy voltage signatures. The NSGA-II algorithm is applied to explore trade-offs between energy yield and sensing precision, including parametric studies on damage severity, damage location, and harvester geometry. Results indicate that optimised PEHs not only act as an effective filter and sensing component but also outperform traditional acceleration-based sensing, improving damage detection accuracy by 13% while reducing energy consumption by 98%. The multi-parameter design space further highlights the importance of bi-objective optimisation due to variations in performance even under resonant conditions. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of replacing traditional sensors with lightweight, self-powered PEHs and pave the way for sustainable simultaneous energy harvesting and sensing (SEHS) systems."}

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems."}

We first introduce an agent to simulate the role of product manager, dubbed PM-Agent, which formulates data requirements to collect data similar to the failure cases.

Moreover, these tools are limited in their ability to generate functional tests that effectively exercise meaningful scenarios. In this work, we present SAINT, a novel white-box testing approach for service-level testing of enterprise Java applications. SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints. SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests. Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage. Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop. We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation. Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT. Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation."}

In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP).

We specifically address a key bottleneck in the original APNNs: the slow convergence of the macroscopic density $ρ$ in the near fluid-dynamic regime, i.e., for small Knudsen numbers $\\varepsilon$. The core innovation of BI-APNNs is a novel bi-fidelity decomposition of the macroscopic quantity $ρ$, which accurately approximates the true density at small $\\varepsilon$, and can be efficiently pre-trained. A separate and more compact neural network is then tasked with learning only the minor correction term, $ρ_{\\text{corr}}$. This strategy not only significantly {\\it accelerates} the training convergence but also improves the accuracy of the forward problem solution, particularly in the challenging fluid-dynamic limit. Meanwhile, we demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our new BI-APNNs yields substantially more accurate and robust results for inverse problems compared to the standard APNNs.

The proof relies on the propagation of the initial $L^\\infty$ bounds, derived from monotonicity properties of the scheme, allowing controlled linearizations within the nonlinear entropy estimates. Moreover, we show that the time-discrete dissipation inherent to the numerical scheme plays a crucial stabilizing role, providing control over the nonlinear terms."}

However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \\textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS."}

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization."}

Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches.

However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks."}

To address this issue, the COLISEUM project proposes a methodology for collecting data in three French sites to predict heritage material behaviour using artificial intelligence computer models. Over time, prediction models will allow the prediction of future material behaviours using known data from different climate change scenarios by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Thus, a climate monitoring methodology has been set up in three cultural sites in France: Notre-Dame cathedral in Strasbourg ( 67), Bibracte archaeological site (71), and the Saint-Pierre chapel in Villefranche-sur-Mer (06). Each site has a different climate and specific materials. In situ, microclimatic sensors continuously record variations parameters over time. The state of alteration is monitored at regular intervals by means of chemical analyses, cartographic measurements and scientific imaging campaigns. To implement weathering models, data is gathered in alteration matrix by mean of a calculated weathering index.

However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture."}

Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks.

Peirce's Manuscripts with Vision-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.MM"], "comment": null, "summary": "Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources."}

A Systematic Evaluation in Real-World Clinical Contexts", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system."}

The method addresses the computational challenges of kinetic simulations by integrating two complementary strategies: a parareal temporal parallelization method and a dynamic spatial domain adaptation based on perturbative analysis. The parallel in time approach employs a coarse fluid solver for efficient temporal propagation coupled with a fine, spatially-hybridized, kinetic solver for accurate resolution. Domain adaptation is governed by two criteria: one measuring the deviation from local velocity equilibrium, and another based on macroscopic quantities available throughout the computational domain. An asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition framework handles the stiffness of the original problem. This fully hybrid methodology significantly reduces computational costs compared to full kinetic approaches by exploiting the lower dimensionality of asymptotic fluid models while maintaining accuracy through selective kinetic resolution. The method demonstrates substantial speedup capabilities and efficiency gains across various kinetic regimes."}

Correlation-based analyses often fail to distinguish true causal drivers from spurious associations, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. This paper applies a time-series causal inference framework to identify the operational factors that directly affect energy efficiency in induction furnace melting. Using production data from a Danish foundry, the study integrates time-series clustering to segment melting cycles into distinct operational modes with the PCMCI+ algorithm, a state-of-the-art causal discovery method, to uncover cause-effect relationships within each mode. Across clusters, robust causal relations among energy consumption, furnace temperature, and material weight define the core drivers of efficiency, while voltage consistently influences cooling water temperature with a delayed response. Cluster-specific differences further distinguish operational regimes: efficient clusters are characterized by stable causal structures, whereas inefficient ones exhibit reinforcing feedback loops and atypical dependencies. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it introduces an integrated clustering-causal inference pipeline as a methodological innovation for analyzing energy-intensive processes. Second, it provides actionable insights that enable foundry operators to optimize performance, reduce energy consumption, and lower emissions."}

This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions.

This transformation reformulates the original eigenvalue problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem, enabling fault-oblivious computation while preserving numerical stability and convergence properties. We formulate the augmentation scheme, establish the necessary conditions for the encoded blocks, and prove the relationship between the original and transformed problems.

However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind."}

Previous methods have struggled with incomplete disentanglement of editable attributes, typically addressing only one aspect - such as editing text content - thus limiting controllability and visual consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose TripleFDS, a novel framework for STE with disentangled modular attributes, and an accompanying dataset called SCB Synthesis. SCB Synthesis provides robust training data for triple feature disentanglement by utilizing the \"SCB Group\", a novel construct that combines three attributes per image to generate diverse, disentangled training groups. Leveraging this construct as a basic training unit, TripleFDS first disentangles triple features, ensuring semantic accuracy through inter-group contrastive regularization and reducing redundancy through intra-sample multi-feature orthogonality. In the synthesis phase, TripleFDS performs feature remapping to prevent \"shortcut\" phenomena during reconstruction and mitigate potential feature leakage. Trained on 125,000 SCB Groups, TripleFDS achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity (SSIM of 44.54) and text accuracy (ACC of 93.58%) on the mainstream STE benchmarks. Besides superior performance, the more flexible editing of TripleFDS supports new operations such as style replacement and background transfer. Code: https://github.com/yusenbao01/TripleFDS"}

In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework.

Experiments on the challenging ViDoRe V2 benchmark show that AGREE significantly outperforms the global-supervision-only baseline. Quantitative and qualitative analyses further demonstrate that AGREE promotes deeper alignment between query terms and document regions, moving beyond surface-level matching toward more accurate and interpretable retrieval.

However, little attention has been paid to hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks, e.g., story writing, where the models are expected to generate novel content beyond the given image. In these tasks, it is inappropriate to simply regard such imagined novel content as hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce Voluntary-imagined Object Presence Evaluation (VOPE)-a novel method to assess LVLMs' hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks via presence evaluation. Specifically, VOPE poses recheck-based questions to evaluate how an LVLM interprets the presence of the imagined objects in its own response. The consistency between the model's interpretation and the object's presence in the image is then used to determine whether the model hallucinates when generating the response. We apply VOPE to several mainstream LVLMs and hallucination mitigation methods, revealing two key findings: (1) most LVLMs hallucinate heavily during voluntary imagination, and their performance in presence evaluation is notably poor on imagined objects; (2) existing hallucination mitigation methods show limited effect in voluntary imagination tasks, making this an important direction for future research."}

This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address the full spectrum of risks that AI poses to democratic societies. Our approach integrates multi-stakeholder participation, civil society engagement, and existing international governance frameworks while introducing novel mechanisms for risk assessment and institutional adaptation. We propose: (1) a seven-category democratic risk taxonomy extending beyond individual-level harms to capture systemic threats, (2) a stakeholder-adaptive Incident Severity Score (ISS) that incorporates diverse perspectives and context-dependent risk factors, and (3) a phased implementation strategy that acknowledges the complex institutional changes required for effective AI governance."}

Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version."}

Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems."}

In a BAM, each alternative has a subset of Boolean attributes, each voter cares about a subset of attributes, and voters prefer alternatives with more of their desired attributes. In the BAM problem, we are given a preference profile and a number k, and want to know whether there is a Boolean k-attribute model explaining the profile.\n  We establish a complexity dichotomy for the number of attributes k: BAM is linear-time solvable for $k \\le 2$ but NP-complete for $k \\ge 3$. The problem remains hard even when preference orders have length two. On the positive side, BAM becomes fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of alternatives m. For the special case of two voters, we provide a linear-time algorithm.\n  We also analyze variants where partial information is given: When voter preferences over attributes are known (BAM WITH CARES) or when alternative attributes are specified (BAM WITH HAS), we show that for most parameters BAM WITH CARES is more difficult whereas BAM WITH HAS is more tractable except for being NP-hard even for one voter."}

Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice."}

This problem is exacerbated by the increasing reliance on AI models as judges for experimental validation, to bypass the cost and implications of running participatory design studies directly with users. Following a user-centred approach, this paper presents preliminary results from a workshop with prospective VLM users.

Moreover, traditional step-wise and episodic RL methods often neglect the contact-rich information inherent in task-space manipulation, especially considering the contact-safety and robustness. In this work, contact-rich manipulation tasks are tackled using a task-space, energy-safe framework, where reliable and safe task-space trajectories are generated through the combination of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and movement primitives. Furthermore, an energy-aware Cartesian Impedance Controller objective is incorporated within the proposed framework to ensure safe interactions between the robot and the environment.

It scales to model sizes and model types that are out of reach for exhaustive, analytical techniques. So far, it has been used to evaluate one property value at a time only. Many practical problems, however, require finding the Pareto front of optimal tradeoffs between multiple possibly conflicting optimisation objectives. In this paper, we present the first statistical model checking approach for such multi-objective Pareto queries, using lightweight strategy sampling to optimise over the model's nondeterministic choices. We first introduce an incremental scheme that almost surely converges to a statistically sound confidence band bounding the true Pareto front from both sides in the long run. To obtain a close underapproximation of the true front in finite time, we then propose three heuristic approaches that try to make the best of an a-priori fixed sampling budget. We implement our new techniques in the Modest Toolset's 'modes' simulator, and experimentally show their effectiveness on quantitative verification benchmarks."}

However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks."}

However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition.\n  Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size.\n  Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model\n  E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0,\n  anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added.\n  The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment. Implementation considerations for CAT/LQA systems and implications for human and AI-generated text evaluation are discussed."}

This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios.

Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline."}

The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found.

We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic.\n  Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores."}

Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs."}

We present a tight and efficient privacy auditing framework for DP-ICL systems that runs membership inference attacks and translates their success rates into empirical privacy guarantees using Gaussian DP. Our analysis of the private voting mechanism identifies vote configurations that maximize the auditing signal, guiding the design of audit queries that reliably reveal whether a canary demonstration is present in the context. The framework supports both black-box (API-only) and white-box (internal vote) threat models, and unifies auditing for classification and generation by reducing both to a binary decision problem. Experiments on standard text classification and generation benchmarks show that our empirical leakage estimates closely match theoretical DP budgets on classification tasks and are consistently lower on generation tasks due to conservative embedding-sensitivity bounds, making our framework a practical privacy auditor and verifier for real-world DP-ICL deployments."}

However, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effectively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelopment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning-based framework to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmentation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV boundaries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the \"remained-demolished-redeveloped\" phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China's four economic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi'an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal transformation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive planning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable urban renewal, while also contributing to a broader global understanding of informal settlement transformations."}

While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{ö}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model.

This study presents a comparative analysis of three Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa) for ransomware detection using two structured datasets: UGRansome and Process Memory (PM). Since LLMs are primarily designed for natural language processing (NLP), numerical and categorical ransomware features were transformed into textual sequences using KBinsDiscretizer and token-based encoding. This enabled the models to learn behavioural patterns from system activity and network traffic through contextual embeddings. The models were fine-tuned on approximately 2,500 labelled samples and evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. To ensure transparent decision-making in this high-stakes domain, two explainable AI techniques (LIME and SHAP) were applied to interpret feature contributions. The results show that the models learn distinct ransomware-related cues: BERT relies heavily on dominant file-operation features, RoBERTa demonstrates balanced reliance on network and financial signals, while DeBERTa exhibits strong sensitivity to financial and network-traffic indicators. Visualisation of embeddings further reveals structural differences in token representation, with RoBERTa producing more isotropic embeddings and DeBERTa capturing highly directional, disentangled patterns. In general, RoBERTa achieved the strongest F1-score, while BERT yielded the highest ROC-AUC performance. The integration of LLMs with XAI provides a transparent framework capable of identifying feature-level evidence behind ransomware predictions."}

Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts.

Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions."}

This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems."}

However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions.

In response, we propose an asymptotically minimax approach to multi-target conformal prediction that provides tight prediction intervals while ensuring joint marginal coverage. We then outline how our minimax approach can be applied to multi-metric blind image quality assessment, multi-task uncertainty quantification, and multi-round measurement acquisition. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the benefits of our minimax method, relative to existing multi-target conformal prediction methods, using both synthetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data."}

In this work, we reveal a new class of attacks that compromise model interpretability without affecting accuracy. Specifically, we show that small color perturbations applied by adversarial clients in a federated learning setting can shift a model's saliency maps away from semantically meaningful regions while keeping the prediction unchanged. The proposed saliency-aware attack framework, called Chromatic Perturbation Module, systematically crafts adversarial examples by altering the color contrast between foreground and background in a way that disrupts explanation fidelity. These perturbations accumulate across training rounds, poisoning the global model's internal feature attributions in a stealthy and persistent manner. Our findings challenge a common assumption in model auditing that correct predictions imply faithful explanations and demonstrate that interpretability itself can be an attack surface. We evaluate this vulnerability across multiple datasets and show that standard training pipelines are insufficient to detect or mitigate explanation degradation, especially in the federated learning setting, where subtle color perturbations are harder to discern. Our attack reduces peak activation overlap in Grad-CAM explanations by up to 35% while preserving classification accuracy above 96% on all evaluated datasets."}

BootOOD synthesizes pseudo-OOD features through simple transformations of ID representations and leverages Neural Collapse (NC), where ID features cluster tightly around class means with consistent feature norms. Unlike prior approaches that aim to constrain OOD features into subspaces orthogonal to the collapsed ID means, BootOOD introduces a lightweight auxiliary head that performs radius-based classification on feature norms. This design decouples OOD detection from the primary classifier and imposes a relaxed requirement: OOD samples are learned to have smaller feature norms than ID features, which is easier to satisfy when ID and OOD are semantically close. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200 show that BootOOD outperforms prior post-hoc methods, surpasses training-based methods without outlier exposure, and is competitive with state-of-the-art outlier-exposure approaches while maintaining or improving ID accuracy."}

Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration.

In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense."}

The teacher network is formulated as a joint regression and classification model: the regression branch predicts height values that serve as pseudo-labels, and the classification branch predicts height value classes along with class probabilities, which are used to filter pseudo-labels. Height value classes are defined using a hierarchical bi-cut strategy to address the inherent long-tailed distribution of heights, and the predicted class probabilities are calibrated with a Plackett-Luce model to reflect the expected accuracy of pseudo-labels. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three datasets spanning different resolutions and imaging modalities. Codes are available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/tse-net."}

The controversial directive obliged telecom and Internet access providers in Europe to retain metadata of all their customers for intelligence and law enforcement purposes, for a period of up to two years. In the ruling, the Court declared the directive in violation of the human rights to privacy and data protection. The Court also confirmed that the mere collection of metadata interferes with the human right to privacy. In addition, the Court developed three new criteria for assessing the level of data security required from a human rights perspective: security measures should take into account the risk of unlawful access to data, and the data's quantity and sensitivity. While organizations that campaigned against the directive have welcomed the ruling, we warn for the risk of proceduralization of mass surveillance law. The Court did not fully condemn mass surveillance that relies on metadata, but left open the possibility of mass surveillance if policymakers lay down sufficient procedural safeguards. Such proceduralization brings systematic risks for human rights. Government agencies, with ample resources, can design complicated systems of procedural oversight for mass surveillance - and claim that mass surveillance is lawful, even if it affects millions of innocent people."}

To enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios, this paper addresses a more challenging task: MVC under multi-source noises, including missing noise and observation noise. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Reliability-Aware Contrastive Deep Multi-View Clustering (RAC-DMVC), which constructs a reliability graph to guide robust representation learning under noisy environments. Specifically, to address observation noise, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction to enhances robustness at the data level, and a reliability-aware noise contrastive learning to mitigates bias in positive and negative pairs selection caused by noisy representations. To handle missing noise, we design a dual-attention imputation to capture shared information across views while preserving view-specific features. In addition, a self-supervised cluster distillation module further refines the learned representations and improves the clustering performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that RAC-DMVC outperforms SOTA methods on multiple evaluation metrics and maintains excellent performance under varying ratios of noise."}

HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback.

In the exploration phase, an Adaptive Weighted Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) method enhances global search to escape local optima.

We study a generalization of this problem to sampling sets from given vectors in the hypersimplex, i.e., outputting sets of size (at most) some $k$ in $[n]$, while maximizing the sampled sets' overlap. Specifically, the expected difference between two output sets should be at most $α$ times their input vectors' $\\ell_1$ distance. A value of $α=O(\\log n)$ is known to be achievable, due to Chen et al.~(ICALP'17). We improve this factor to $O(\\log k)$, independent of the ambient dimension~$n$.

Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks."}

Our primary goal is to speed up light client protocols so that, e.g., a user can verify a transaction efficiently from their smartphone.\n  For instance, the Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) yields a succinct scheme: a light client synchronizing for the first time can do so with a complexity sublinear in $|X|$. On the other hand, the Merkle chain, traditionally used to commit to block headers, is not succinct, but it is incremental - a light client resynchronizing frequently can do so with constant complexity - and optimally additive - the structure can be updated in constant time when a new item is appended to list $X$.\n  We introduce new Merkle structures, most notably the Merkle Mountain Belt (MMB), the first to be simultaneously succinct, incremental and optimally additive. A variant called UMMB is also asynchronous: a light client may continue to interact with the network even when out of sync with the public commitment. Our Merkle structures are slightly unbalanced, so that items recently appended to $X$ receive shorter membership proofs than older items. This feature reduces a light client's expected costs, in applications where queries are biased towards recently generated data."}

Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability.\n  To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction."}

Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its \"draft one step, then verify one step\" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm."}

Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs."}

In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \\lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks."}

HVI color space has made significant progress in this task by enabling precise decoupling of chrominance and luminance. However, for the interaction of chrominance and luminance branches, substantial distributional differences between the two branches prevalent in natural images limit complementary feature extraction, and luminance errors are propagated to chrominance channels through the nonlinear parameter. Furthermore, for interaction between different chrominance branches, images with large homogeneous-color regions usually exhibit weak correlation between chrominance branches due to concentrated distributions. Traditional pixel-wise losses exploit strong inter-branch correlations for co-optimization, causing gradient conflicts in weakly correlated regions. Therefore, we propose an Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction (ICLR) framework including a Dual-stream Interaction Enhancement Module (DIEM) and a Covariance Correction Loss (CCL). The DIEM improves the extraction of complementary information from two dimensions, fusion and enhancement, respectively. The CCL utilizes luminance residual statistics to penalize chrominance errors and balances gradient conflicts by constraining chrominance branches covariance.

As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations.

This dual approach places OMERO at the heart of the bioimaging analysis process: the importer ensures provenance from image acquisition through preprocessing and import into OMERO, while the analyzer records it for downstream processing. These integrated layers enhance OMEROs FAIRification, supporting traceable, reusable workflows for image analysis that bridge the gap between data import, analysis, and sharing."}

In this work, we manage to advance physics research by developing large language models with exceptional physics reasoning capabilities, especially excel at solving Olympiad-level physics problems. We introduce P1, a family of open-source physics reasoning models trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL).

P1-30B-A3B also surpasses almost all other open-source models on IPhO 2025, getting a silver medal. Further equipped with an agentic framework PhysicsMinions, P1-235B-A22B+PhysicsMinions achieves overall No.1 on IPhO 2025, and obtains the highest average score over the 13 physics competitions.

We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks.

This study shows development of a Driver Drowsiness Detection System meant to improve the safety of the road by alerting drivers who are showing signs of being drowsy. The system is based on a standard webcam that tracks the facial features of the driver with the main emphasis on the examination of eye movements that can be conducted with the help of the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method. The Face Mesh by MediaPipe is a lightweight framework that can identify facial landmarks with high accuracy and efficiency, which is considered to be important in real time use. The system detects the moments of long eye shutdowns or a very low rate of blinking which are manifestations of drowsiness and alerts the driver through sound to get her attention back. This system achieves a high-performance and low-cost driver monitoring solution with the help of the computational power of OpenCV to process the image and the MediaPipe to identify faces. Test data experimental analyses indicate that the system is very accurate and responds quicker; this confirms that it can be a component of the current Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS)."}

Recently introduced $α$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly for their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $α>1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $α$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a critical training instability in A3M-caused by the interplay of penalized logits and sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is crucial for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount."}

A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches."}

However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization. The prevalence of unstable transitions (45.8%) and stimulus-specific sensitivities suggests current AI systems lack unified preference structures, raising concerns about deployment in contexts requiring complex value trade-offs."}

While synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it often introduces systematic distributional discrepancies, particularly underrepresenting long-tail knowledge due to truncation effects from data generation mechanisms like top-p sampling, temperature scaling, and finite sampling. These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets. Comprehensive experiments across four tasks, including image classification, sentiment classification, instruction following, and complex reasoning, demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in data valuation with significantly low computational cost."}

We present Rebound, a general-purpose security framework that preserves rollback protection while enabling policy-authorized legitimate rollbacks of application binaries, configuration, and data. Key to Rebound is a reference monitor that mediates state transitions, enforces authorization policy, guarantees atomicity of state updates and rollbacks, and emits a tamper-evident log that provides transparency to applications and auditors.

We introduce CacheFlow, a training-free pipeline that pairs Dynamic Token Dropping (DTD) with a compressive long-term memory. DTD prunes per-patch tokens online via cosine similarity to the previous frame, and surviving tokens are packed into fixed-size blocks. This online, per-frame processing makes our approach fundamentally suited for live streaming VQA. As blocks are processed, each one's keys are summarized by a tiny recurrent encoder to form a retrieval index, while the block's full KV pairs are offloaded and later rehydrated for generation, preserving answer fidelity. At inference, a consensus-based retrieval mechanism retrieves only the Top-K most relevant blocks and attends over both the retrieved and local context for precise, long-range reasoning. CacheFlow is drop-in, architecture-agnostic, and requires no fine-tuning. Experiments on both offline and streaming VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CacheFlow outperforms current strong baselines, while processing up to 87% less tokens. Our dual approach enables VLMs to be both efficient and context-aware, paving the way for practical long-form video understanding."}

In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%."}

We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously.

These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models.

We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$.

This article explores the non-technical aspects emphasized in SE job postings, revealing the sociotechnical and organizational expectations of employers. Our Thematic Analysis of 100 job postings shows that employers seek candidates who align with their sense of purpose, fit within company culture, pursue personal and career growth, and excel in interpersonal interactions. This study contributes to ongoing discussions in the SE community about the evolving role and workplace context of software engineers beyond technical skills. By highlighting these expectations, we provide relevant insights for researchers, educators, practitioners, and recruiters. Additionally, our analysis offers a valuable snapshot of SE job postings in 2023, providing a scientific record of prevailing trends and expectations."}

Using LLMs to Discover Language Phenomena from Lexical Cues", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Deceptive reviews mislead consumers, harm businesses, and undermine trust in online marketplaces. Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable."}

To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders."}

Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism.

Grounded in contingency theory and quality theory, the study examines the role of P-AI fit in managerial decision-making through a proof-of-concept case study involving a real hiring process for a Senior AI Lead. Three decision pathways are compared: (1) independent evaluations by a CEO, CTO, and CSO; (2) an evaluation produced by an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system (H3LIX-LAIZA); and (3) an assessment generated by a general-purpose large language model. The results reveal substantial role-based divergence in human judgments, high alignment between H3LIX-LAIZA and the CEOs implicit decision model-including ethical disqualification of a high-risk candidate and a critical false-positive recommendation from the LLMr. The findings demonstrate that higher P-AI fit, exemplified by the CEO H3LIX-LAIZA relationship, functions as a mechanism linking augmented symbiotic intelligence to accurate, trustworthy, and context-sensitive decisions. The study provides an initial verification of the P-AI fit construct and a proof-of-concept for H3LIX-LAIZA as an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system."}

This paper presents T-SAR, the first framework to achieve scalable ternary LLM inference on CPUs by repurposing the SIMD register file for dynamic, in-register LUT generation with minimal hardware modifications. T-SAR eliminates memory bottlenecks and maximizes data-level parallelism, delivering 5.6-24.5x and 1.1-86.2x improvements in GEMM latency and GEMV throughput, respectively, with only 3.2% power and 1.4% area overheads in SIMD units.

We show the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the Publication Choice Problem and its uniqueness under binary researcher types. Our characterizations of the equilibrium properties offer insights about what publication behaviors better indicate a researcher's impact level.

GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines.

Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement.

However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience."}

Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems."}

The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch."}

Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks."}

However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field."}

Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching.

Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning."}

In this work, we present FFSE, a 3D-aware autoregressive framework designed to enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. Unlike previous approaches that either operate in image space or require slow and error-prone 3D reconstruction, FFSE models editing as a sequence of learned 3D transformations, allowing users to perform arbitrary manipulations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, while preserving realistic background effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) and maintaining global scene consistency across multiple editing rounds. To support learning of multi-round 3D-aware object manipulation, we introduce 3DObjectEditor, a hybrid dataset constructed from simulated editing sequences across diverse objects and scenes, enabling effective training under multi-round and dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FFSE significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-round and multi-round 3D-aware editing scenarios."}

Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models."}

Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.\n  Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.\n  We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device.

We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En).

Code at https://github.com/LTH14/JiT", "summary": "Today's denoising diffusion models do not \"denoise\" in the classical sense, i.e., they do not directly predict clean images. Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than \"$\\textbf{Just image Transformers}$\", or $\\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data."}

The task of unsupervised learning is to find the probability distribution that would best describe the available data, and then use it to make predictions for observables of interest. Classical models generally fit the data to Boltzmann distribution of Hamiltonians with a large number of tunable parameters. Quantum extensions of these models replace classical probability distributions with quantum density matrices. An advantage can be obtained only when features of density matrices that are absent in classical probability distributions are exploited. Such situations depend on the input data as well as the targeted observables. Explicit examples are discussed that bring out the constraints limiting possible quantum advantage. The problem-dependent extent of quantum advantage has implications for both data analysis and sensing applications."}

Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data.

However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the \"more is better\" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science."}

This research study focuses on understanding the mode choice behavior of individuals with travel-limited disabilities and comparing the group with no such disability. The study identified key factors influencing mode preferences for both groups by utilizing Utah's household travel survey, simulation algorithm and Multinomial Logit model. Explanatory variables include household and socio-demographic attributes, personal, trip characteristics, and built environment variables. The analysis revealed intriguing trends, including a shift towards carpooling among disabled individuals. People with disabilities placed less emphasis on travel time saving. A lower value of travel time for people with disabilities is potentially due to factors like part-time work, reduced transit fare, and no or shared cost for carpooling. Despite a 50% fare reduction for the disabled group, transit accessibility remains a significant barrier in their choice of Transit mode. In downtown areas, people with no disability were found to choose transit compared to driving, whereas disabled people preferred carpooling. Travelers with no driving licenses and disabled people who use transit daily showed complex travel patterns among multiple modes. The study emphasizes the need for accessible and inclusive transportation options, such as improved public transit services, shorter first and last miles in transit, and better connectivity for non-motorized modes, to cater to the unique needs of disabled travelers. The findings of this study have significant policy implications such as an inclusive mode choice modeling framework for creating a more sustainable and inclusive transportation system."}

A key barrier is the lack of principled protein structure tokenizers (PSTs): existing approaches fix token size or rely on continuous vector codebooks, limiting interpretability, multi-scale control, and transfer across architectures. We introduce GeoBPE, a geometry-grounded PST that transforms continuous, noisy, multi-scale backbone conformations into discrete ``sentences'' of geometry while enforcing global constraints. Analogous to byte-pair encoding, GeoBPE generates a hierarchical vocabulary of geometric primitives by iteratively (i) clustering Geo-Pair occurrences with k-medoids to yield a resolution-controllable vocabulary; (ii) quantizing each Geo-Pair to its closest medoid prototype; and (iii) reducing drift through differentiable inverse kinematics that optimizes boundary glue angles under an $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ end-frame loss. GeoBPE offers compression ($>$10x reduction in bits-per-residue at similar distortion rate), data efficiency ($>$10x less training data), and generalization (maintains test/train distortion ratio of $1.0-1.1$). It is architecture-agnostic: (a) its hierarchical vocabulary provides a strong inductive bias for coarsening residue-level embeddings from large PLMs into motif- and protein-level representations, consistently outperforming leading PSTs across $12$ tasks and $24$ test splits; (b) paired with a transformer, GeoBPE supports unconditional backbone generation via language modeling; and (c) tokens align with CATH functional families and support expert-interpretable case studies, offering functional meaning absent in prior PSTs.

This settles the central question of a line of research initiated by Erdős and Pyber (1997) for graphs, and more recently by Csirmaz, Ligeti, and Tardos (2014) for hypergraphs. The $d=2$ case of this theorem answers a 40-year-old question of Chung, Erdős, and Spencer (1983). An immediate corollary of our result is an improved upper bound for the maximum share size for binary secret sharing schemes on uniform hypergraphs.\n  Building on results of Nechiporuk (1969), we prove that every graph with fixed edge density $γ\\in (0,1)$ has a biclique partition of total weight at most $(\\tfrac{1}{2}+o(1))\\cdot h_2(γ) \\frac{n^2}{\\lg n}$, where $h_2$ is the binary entropy function. Our construction implies that such biclique partitions can be constructed in time $O(m)$, which answers a question of Feder and Motwani (1995) and also improves upon results of Mubayi and Turán (2010) as well as Chavan, Rabinia, Grosu, and Brocanelli (2025).

We introduce a strategy that incorporates this structure by classifying events according to their underlying interaction type prior to energy reconstruction. Using supervised machine-learning techniques trained on labeled generator events, we leverage intrinsic kinematic differences among quasi-elastic scattering, meson-exchange current, resonance production, and deep-inelastic scattering processes. A cross-generator testing framework demonstrates that this classification approach is robust to microphysics mismodeling and, when applied to a simulated DUNE $ν_μ$ disappearance analysis, yields improved accuracy and sensitivity. These results highlight a practical path toward reducing reconstruction-driven systematics in future oscillation measurements."}

Raman spectroscopy offers molecularly specific fingerprints but suffers from spectral noise, fluorescence background, and band overlap, limiting its real-world applicability. Here, we propose a deep learning framework based on ResNet-18 feature extraction, combined with advanced classifiers, including XGBoost, SVM, and their hybrid integration, to detect pesticides and dyes from Raman spectroscopy, called MLRaman. The MLRaman with the CNN-XGBoost model achieved a predictive accuracy of 97.4% and a perfect AUC of 1.0, while it with the CNN-SVM model provided competitive results with robust class-wise discrimination. Dimensionality reduction analyses (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) confirmed the separability of Raman embeddings across 10 analytes, including 7 pesticides and 3 dyes. Finally, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time prediction, which successfully identified unseen Raman spectra from our independent experiments and also literature sources, underscoring strong generalization capacity. This study establishes a scalable, practical MLRaman model for multi-residue contaminant monitoring, with significant potential for deployment in food safety and environmental surveillance."}

This paper employs reinforcement learning to optimize piecewise-constant charging policies for an inhomogeneous Dicke battery. We systematically compare policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables (energies of individual two-level systems (TLSs), first-order averages, and second-order correlations). Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline. The learned schedules are nonmyopic, trading temporary plateaus or declines for superior terminal outcomes. These findings highlight a practical route to effective fast-charging protocols under realistic information constraints."}

Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations. This fragment-based strategy eliminates the need for large-molecule training data while maintaining high scalability and transferability. By embedding chemical principles into key steps, StoL ensures faster convergence, chemically rational structures, and broad configurational coverage, as confirmed against DFT calculations."}

To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises.

Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as CRYSTALS-Kyber provide efficient quantum-resistant primitives but rely solely on computational hardness assumptions that are susceptible to hybrid classical-quantum attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-certified Kyber protocol, which embeds quantum non-locality verification directly within the key exchange phase. The proposed design integrates CHSH entanglement tests using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to yield measurable quantum advantage values exceeding classical correlation limits, thereby coupling information--theoretic quantum guarantees with lattice-based computational security. Formal reductions demonstrate that any polynomial-time adversary breaking the proposed KEM must either solve the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem or a Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete instance of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem, under the standard complexity assumption QMA $\\subset$ NP. The construction remains fully compatible with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, preserving chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security and Kyber's efficiency profile.

In our setting, each job is equipped with a Boolean formula (precedence constraint) over the set of jobs. A schedule satisfies a job's precedence constraint if setting earlier jobs to true satisfies the formula. Our definition generalizes several common types of precedence constraints: classical and-constraints if every formula is a conjunction, or-constraints if every formula is a disjunction, and and/or-constraints if every formula is in conjunctive normal form. We prove fixed-parameter tractability when parameterizing by the number of predecessors. For parameterization by the number of successors, however, the complexity depends on the structure of the precedence constraints. If every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction, we prove the problem to be fixed-parameter tractable. For constraints in disjunctive normal form, we prove W[1]-hardness. We show that the and/or-constrained problem is NP-hard, even for a single successor. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction. This result not only proves para-NP-hardness for parameterization by the number of machines but also complements the polynomial-time solvability on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction (Coffman and Graham 1972) or if every constraint is a disjunction (Berit 2005)."}

In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning.

Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability.

An effective visual system therefore needs unified scene representations that relate scene parts to their location and their co-occurrence. We hypothesize that this structure can be learned self-supervised from natural experience by exploiting the temporal regularities of active vision: each fixation reveals a locally-detailed glimpse that is statistically related to the previous one via co-occurrence and saccade-conditioned spatial regularities. We instantiate this idea with Glimpse Prediction Networks (GPNs) -- recurrent models trained to predict the feature embedding of the next glimpse along human-like scanpaths over natural scenes. GPNs successfully learn co-occurrence structure and, when given relative saccade location vectors, show sensitivity to spatial arrangement. Furthermore, recurrent variants of GPNs were able to integrate information across glimpses into a unified scene representation. Notably, these scene representations align strongly with human fMRI responses during natural-scene viewing across mid/high-level visual cortex. Critically, GPNs outperform architecture- and dataset-matched controls trained with explicit semantic objectives, and match or exceed strong modern vision baselines, leaving little unique variance for those alternatives.

These databases typically describe relationships in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. However, few evaluation metrics have been developed that take this qualitative nature into account. To address this, we developed a metric, the sign-augmented Structural Intervention Distance (sSID), and a weighted sSID that incorporates the net effects of the intervention. Through simulations and analyses of real transcriptomic datasets, we found that our proposed metrics could identify a different algorithm as optimal compared to conventional metrics, and the network selected by sSID had a superior performance in the classification task of clinical covariates using transcriptomic data. This suggests that sSID can distinguish networks that are structurally correct but functionally incorrect, highlighting its potential as a more biologically meaningful and practical evaluation metric."}

With the growing availability of data and compute, machine learning has become a promising alternative to first-principles methods to build accurate macroscopic models from microscopic trajectory simulations. However, for spatially extended systems, direct simulations of sufficiently large microscopic systems that inform macroscopic behavior is prohibitive. In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical upsampling scheme that enables efficient generation of large-system snapshots from small-system trajectory distributions. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our framework through a variety of stochastic spatially extended systems, including those described by stochastic partial differential equations, idealised lattice spin systems, and a more realistic NbMoTa alloy system."}

However, due to the exponential scaling cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), a compressed sensing technique, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large systems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction infidelity by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation. Our work advances the state of low-rank QST and may be applicable to other quantum tomography protocols."}

Truck platooning can mitigate range anxiety through energy savings and, in turn, influence routing and charging decisions, yet most existing studies focus on a single highway corridor and do not capture network-wide operations. We study electric truck platooning on a general road network, where trucks must select routes and charging stations with heterogeneous prices and charging speeds, form platoons on shared arcs, and possibly take detours that trade off platoon savings with additional labor hours. We further allow in-platoon position swaps so that leading responsibility rotates, balancing battery usage and avoiding early depletion of any single truck. To jointly optimize routing paths, charging-station choices, labor time, and platoon formation and position swaps, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Because exact methods become intractable on realistic instances, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with a savings-based bounding scheme, infeasible-pair elimination, and candidate-station filtering. Computational experiments on test instances with up to 150 trucks show that incorporating platooning can reduce total operational costs by up to 2.77 percent, while the proposed algorithm cuts computation time by up to 99.96 percent compared with CPLEX and solves 150-truck instances in about 120 seconds, indicating strong potential for real-world applications."}

Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions."}

They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.\n  We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation."}

Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying the surface-color code mapping, the thresholds of 16.62% and 3.52% are obtained for the surface code against depolarizing noise."}

The key innovation is the incorporation of causal effect estimation for identifying stable biomarkers, coupled with a GNN-based propensity scoring mechanism that leverages cross-gene regulatory networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy across four distinct datasets and four independent classifiers.

To accelerate this process for experimentalists, we implement Qalibrate, a fast, JAX-enabled simulator that generates pulses given target unitaries. Specifically, we generate a propagator that models the time evolution of three-electron spin qubits and integrate our gradient-based optimizer to generate the pulses.

However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus\" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing."}

In this work, we propose and study a model of opinion dynamics on $d$-uniform hypergraphs, where individuals interact through group-based (higher-order) structures rather than simple pairwise connections. Each one of the two opinions $A$ and $B$ is characterized by a quality, $Q_A$ and $Q_B$, and agents update their opinions according to a general mechanism that takes into account the weighted fraction of agents supporting either opinion and the pooling error, $α$, a proxy for the information lost during the interaction. Through bifurcation analysis of the mean-field model, we identify two critical thresholds, $α_{\\text{crit}}^{(1)}$ and $α_{\\text{crit}}^{(2)}$, which delimit stability regimes for the consensus states. These analytical predictions are validated through extensive agent-based simulations on both random and scale-free hypergraphs. Moreover, the analytical framework demonstrates that the bifurcation structure and critical thresholds are independent of the underlying topology of the higher-order network, depending solely on the parameters $d$, i.e., the size of the interaction groups, and the quality ratio. Finally, we bring to the fore a nontrivial effect: the large sizes of the interaction groups, could drive the system toward the adoption of the worst option."}
